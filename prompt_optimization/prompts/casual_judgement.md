# Task
**Revised Instruction:**

"For each question about causation, classify the event in question as an **actual cause**, **not a cause**, or **a contributing factor** in relation to the outcome. An actual cause is an event that directly and necessarily contributed to the outcome, even if other events could have also played a role. A contributing factor is an event that played a role in bringing about the outcome but was neither strictly necessary nor sufficient on its own. If the event did not directly contribute to the outcome, even though it may have occurred simultaneously, it should be classified as **not a cause**. Take into account the **logical relationships between the conditions** (such as whether the event functioned as a sufficient condition, a necessary condition, or one of several sufficient conditions), and whether the event **inevitably resulted in the outcome** within the specific context. Refrain from assuming intent or assigning direct responsibility unless clearly indicated. Provide a response that is **clear, logical, and consistent** with the information given."
