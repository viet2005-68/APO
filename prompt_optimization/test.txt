LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt might be incorrectly identifying statements as lies due to its reliance on a binary "lie or not" framework without considering the context or verifiability of the statement.

The prompt needs to distinguish between objective facts and subjective opinions when determining if a statement is a lie.", "Another issue might be the lack of consideration for the source's credibility or expertise. In Example 4, the statement about income tax distribution is a complex economic claim that requires specialized knowledge to verify. Without additional context about the speaker's expertise or evidence provided, the prompt might incorrectly label the statement as a lie due to its complexity and potential inaccuracy.", 'The prompt could also be struggling with statements that contain partial truths or mixed information. In Example 6, the statement about census return rates might be partially true but also misleading. The prompt needs to evaluate the overall truthfulness of the statement rather than just focusing on specific parts.', "Lastly, the prompt might be too rigid in its interpretation of what constitutes a lie, leading to incorrect classifications. In Example 8, the statement about prison conditions might be an exaggeration or hyperbole rather than a complete lie. The prompt should allow for nuance in evaluating the truthfulness of statements, considering factors like the speaker's intent and the broader context."]

In Example 6, Chris Jacobs, who is a local politician, is making a claim about the state government's handling of tax revenues. The prompt should evaluate such claims based on the speaker's authority and the plausibility of the statement within the given context.", "The prompt may be too simplistic and lacks context-specific nuance required to accurately evaluate the truthfulness of statements. It fails to consider factors such as the speaker's role, the specific context of the statement, and the reliability of the source, which are crucial in determining the accuracy of claims.", 'The prompt\'s binary "lie" or "not lie" classification may not be appropriate for all statements, particularly those that are ambiguous or require additional research to verify. The presence of incomplete or missing information (e.g., job title, state, party) can further complicate the evaluation process, leading to incorrect classifications.', 'The prompt does not specify how to handle statements that are partially true but contain inaccuracies. In such cases, the overall statement might still be considered a lie, but the prompt\'s straightforward "lie" or "not lie" approach does not capture this complexity.', 'The prompt might be incorrectly identifying statements as lies due to its reliance on a binary "lie or not" framework without considering the context or verifiability of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be an exaggeration but not necessarily a lie, especially without evidence to support the claim or refute it. The prompt should account for the possibility that some statements might be exaggerated or inaccurate but not outright false.', "Another issue might be the lack of consideration for the source's credibility or expertise. In Example 4, the statement about income tax distribution is a complex economic claim that requires specialized knowledge to verify. Without additional context about the speaker's expertise or evidence provided, the prompt might incorrectly label the statement as a lie due to its complexity and potential inaccuracy.", 'The prompt could also be struggling with statements that contain partial truths or mixed information. In Example 6, the statement about census return rates might be partially true but also misleading. The prompt needs to evaluate the overall truthfulness of the statement rather than just focusing on specific parts.'] items,

In Example 2, the statement about unemployment numbers is a factual claim that requires data verification. Without access to real-time or historical unemployment data, the model cannot accurately assess the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt lacks the ability to understand complex relationships between different entities and economic policies.

Similarly, in Example 3, the claim about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is factually incorrect, yet the model failed to recognize it.", 'The prompt does not account for the context and specific knowledge required to evaluate certain statements accurately. In Example 2, the statement about job creation is likely false according to reliable economic data, but the model might not have access to this external information.

This issue is also present in Example 7, where the exact number of deaths due to the American slave trade is a well-established historical fact, which the model might not know.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between types of claims or the level of certainty required to label a statement as a lie. Statements like the one in Example 8, which is based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence, might be harder to verify than factual claims. The model might struggle to distinguish between a personal story and a widely accepted fact, leading to incorrect predictions.', 'The prompt lacks the ability to cross-reference statements with broader knowledge bases or databases of verified facts. For example, in Example 3, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is false but would require checking a property tax database, which the model cannot do.

For instance, in Example 4, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker could be scrutinized given the political context involving a Democratic representative and a Republican governor. The prompt should consider these contextual factors to improve accuracy.", 'The prompt might not be correctly interpreting the nature of the statements due to a lack of specificity in determining what constitutes a "lie." Statements like the one in Example 3, which involves media coverage and potential bias, require a nuanced understanding of journalistic practices and political influence, which the current prompt does not capture effectively.', 'The prompt might be failing to recognize the complexity of certain statements, especially those involving historical facts or economic data. In Example 5, the statement about the American slave trade causing millions of deaths is a well-established historical fact, and the label "Yes" implies that the statement is false, which is incorrect. The prompt needs to handle such factual statements more carefully.', 'The prompt could be misinterpreting the context of the statement, particularly when the job title, state, and party affiliation are relevant. In Example 2, the statement made by the Milwaukee County Executive about state budget shortfalls would likely be accurate within their jurisdiction, making the label "Yes" inappropriate. The prompt should incorporate these contextual elements to better assess the truthfulness of statements.', 'The prompt may not be adequately considering the source of the statement, such as the medium or platform through which it was disseminated.

The prompt may not adequately distinguish between factual claims and opinions, leading to a misclassification.', 'In Example 4, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is likely false given the unique nature of professional sports teams and their tax status. The prompt might not effectively capture the nuances of such specific factual claims.', 'Example 5’s statement about campaign contributions from electric utilities could be a factual claim that requires verification, but the prompt might not prompt the necessary due diligence to ensure the statement is accurate.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt might have gotten these examples wrong because it does not adequately account for the specific context and reliability of the source when evaluating factual claims. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about unemployment numbers is a factual claim that should be evaluated against actual statistical data, which may not align with the congressman's statement. The prompt should emphasize the importance of verifying such claims against reliable sources.", "In Example 2, the statement about criticizing the war before it started is more about the speaker's historical position rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt does not sufficiently distinguish between factual claims and subjective opinions or historical facts, leading to incorrect classifications.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about the retirement fund that requires verification against financial records or official reports. The prompt should include a step to research and cross-check such claims with available data before making a judgment.', 'For Example 4, the statement about employment law needs to be checked against existing labor laws and regulations. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify legal and regulatory claims against authoritative sources.', 'In Example 5, the price increase of Slim Jims is a factual claim that requires checking against retail prices or company records.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the nature of the statements and the context in which they are made. It focuses on general factors like the speaker's role and reliability without providing specific criteria for evaluating factual accuracy. For instance, in Example 1, the prompt might not have recognized that the statement about the death tax is a factual claim that can be verified independently of the speaker's role or the context of a campaign material.", "In some cases, the prompt may have failed to distinguish between statements that require factual verification and those that do not. For example, in Example 2, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes is a specific claim that can be fact-checked against Toomey's public records or policy positions. The prompt might have incorrectly assumed that such a statement would be verified within the context of the press release.", 'The prompt might have underestimated the complexity of evaluating statements made by political figures in various contexts. In Example 3, the statement about Milwaukee having the second-highest number of children recovered from sex trafficking is a statistical claim that requires rigorous data validation. The prompt’s reliance on the speaker’s role and the context alone may not be sufficient to determine the veracity of such a specific and verifiable statement.', "The prompt may not have adequately addressed the nuanced nature of historical claims, as seen in Example 7. The statement about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more is a well-documented historical fact that can be supported by extensive research and data. The prompt’s focus on the context and the speaker's role might have led to an incorrect assessment, failing to recognize the factual basis of the claim.", 'For subjective statements or comparisons, the prompt may have lacked clear guidelines on how to evaluate their truthfulness. In Example 8, the statement comparing tax deductions for different donors is a subjective and potentially misleading claim that requires careful analysis of the actual tax policies. The prompt’s approach to verifying such statements based on the speaker’s role and context might not be sufficient to catch the potential misrepresentation.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly specify how to handle factual claims versus opinions or statistical assertions. In Examples 1-8, the statements are either factual claims or statistical assertions that can be objectively verified, yet the predictions are incorrect. This suggests the classifier might be too lenient in accepting statements as true without sufficient evidence or context.', "The prompt does not adequately address the role of expert opinion in certain contexts. In Example 5, the statement about the New York Times' coverage of Donald Trump's tax returns is a matter of journalistic practice and editorial judgment, which may not be easily verifiable through simple factual checks. The prompt should consider the nature of the statement more carefully, especially when it pertains to professional standards or practices.", 'The prompt lacks clarity on how to handle statements that are partially true but contain inaccuracies. In Example 3, the statement about job creation under different parties is likely to be partially accurate but also contains inaccuracies in the exact figures. The current prompt seems to label such statements as lies without considering the overall truthfulness, which can lead to misclassification.', "The prompt does not sufficiently account for the context and reliability of the source. In Example 4, the statement about 29 states no longer having a death tax is a policy claim that requires specific data and verification. Without additional context about the source's expertise or the availability of reliable data, the classifier might incorrectly label the statement as a lie.", 'The prompt may not be robust enough to handle subjective claims or personal anecdotes. In Example 7, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is a factual claim that can be verified independently. However, if the statement is based on a personal anecdote or an opinion, the classifier might incorrectly label it as a lie due to its subjective nature. The prompt needs to better distinguish between factual claims and subjective opinions.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt might be getting these examples wrong because it does not explicitly account for the fact that some statements are factual claims that require verifiable data, even when made by public figures. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about being the most highly taxed nation is a factual claim that can be verified against official data, regardless of the speaker's role or the context of the statement. The prompt should include a clause that emphasizes the importance of verifying factual claims with evidence, especially when they pertain to statistics or rankings.", 'In Examples 3 and 4, the statements involve political figures making claims about disapproval ratings and water usage, which are matters of public record and can be fact-checked. The prompt should clarify that statements made by politicians or public officials, particularly those involving measurable outcomes like approval ratings or economic indicators, should be evaluated based on available data rather than subjective judgment.', "The prompt may not sufficiently distinguish between personal anecdotes and factual claims. In Example 5, the statement about Romneycare’s impact is a factual claim that requires evidence to support or refute. The prompt should instruct classifiers to treat such claims as factual assertions, requiring verification, rather than simply considering the speaker's political affiliation or the medium of their statement.", 'Examples 6 and 7 involve statements about unemployment and budget shortfalls, which are specific and quantifiable issues that can be verified through official statistics or reports. The prompt needs to include guidance on treating such statements as factual claims that must be supported by verifiable data, rather than relying solely on the context or the speaker’s credibility.', "In Example 8, the statement about voting on tax increases is a specific action that can be verified through official records. The prompt should include instructions to treat such claims as factual assertions that need to be checked against official records, rather than evaluating them based on the speaker's position or the context of the statement."]

For personal anecdotes or subjective opinions, determine if they need to be verified factually before labeling them as a lie.

Take into account the credibility and reliability of the source, including the medium or platform through which the statement was disseminated. Statements made during official meetings or in reputable news outlets are generally more reliable than those from less credible sources.

Verify legal and regulatory claims against authoritative sources. For example, when evaluating statements about employment law, tax laws, or other specific regulations, cross-reference with official government documents or legal databases.

When dealing with specific factual claims, especially those related to unique situations or industries, research and verify against relevant expert sources or industry-specific data. For instance, the tax status of professional sports teams or campaign finance laws involving specific industries require detailed checks.

Provide your reasoning for the classification, explaining how you considered the context, the reliability of the source, and any relevant background knowledge or verifications.

Remember to consider the complexity of relationships between different entities and economic policies. Ensure that you have the necessary knowledge base to recognize inconsistencies or inaccuracies, and seek out additional training or resources if needed.,

When evaluating factual claims, such as those related to official actions or policies, verify the information against official records or credible sources. For example, statements about voting on tax increases should be checked against official records.

Take into account the credibility and reliability of the source when making your assessment. For instance, statements made during a county commission meeting are more likely to be accurate compared to statements made on a satirical show. Consider the medium or platform through which the statement was disseminated.

For specific factual claims, such as those involving unique situations like the tax status of professional sports teams, use relevant background knowledge to evaluate the accuracy of the statement.

Statements involving media coverage and potential bias, such as those found in political discourse, require a nuanced understanding of journalistic practices and political influence. Consider the source of the information and the potential for bias in your evaluation.

When dealing with historical statements, consider the historical context and any known facts about the event or practice in question. For example, statements about military practices and legal decisions should be evaluated with an understanding of the historical context and any relevant legal precedents.

For example, in Example 1, the statement about playing in a game with significant snowfall is plausible given the context of ESPN, which often covers sports events with weather conditions. The prompt might not have recognized the likelihood of such a scenario occurring.', "In Example 2, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is likely false, as NFL teams generally do not pay property taxes. The prompt's focus on the job title, state, and political party might not have sufficiently considered the factual content of the statement, which is easily verifiable through public records or sports league regulations.", "Example 3 involves a historical fact regarding the American slave trade, which is well-documented and widely accepted. The prompt's failure to recognize this established historical truth highlights a potential issue with how it evaluates factual claims, especially when they are supported by substantial evidence and academic consensus.", 'In Example 4, the statement about birthright citizenship is factually incorrect according to U.S. law. However, the prompt\'s prediction of "No" suggests it might not have correctly assessed the factual accuracy of the statement, particularly in the context of a political debate where such misinformation might be intentionally spread.', 'Example 5 involves a specific claim about the Obama administration\'s actions regarding missile defense facilities, which is likely to be a complex and detailed policy matter.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt fails to adequately consider the context and source of the statement.

Similarly, in Example 2, the Mayor\'s claim about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is specific and verifiable, hence should also be labeled as "No". These examples suggest that the prompt may be too skeptical of official statements without proper verification.', 'The prompt does not sufficiently account for the speaker\'s credibility and the nature of the claim. In Example 3, the statement is a conspiracy theory attributed to a conservative website, which is known for spreading misinformation. Therefore, the label "Yes" is correct. The same applies to Example 4, where the statement is attributed to a Republican, aligning with their tendency to spread false narratives about the Obama administration. The prompt needs to consider the reliability of the source and the political leanings of the speaker.', "The prompt lacks flexibility in handling different types of claims. In Example 5, the statement is a personal reflection by a President-Elect, which is subjective and less likely to be false. The prompt should recognize that not all statements need to be fact-checked, especially when they are self-reflective. Similarly, in Example 6, the statement about Milwaukee's rate of child sex trafficking is a serious accusation and should be taken seriously unless proven otherwise, rather than being dismissed.", 'The prompt may be overly critical of statements made by officials, particularly those from opposing parties. In Example 7, the statement about the death tax is a political narrative and may contain inaccuracies, but it is not necessarily a lie. The prompt should balance skepticism with recognition that political rhetoric can contain exaggerations and misrepresentations. Example 8 shows the same issue, where the statement about unemployment numbers is likely a simplification or selective reporting of data, and labeling it as a lie is too harsh.', 'The prompt does not effectively distinguish between verifiable facts and subjective opinions. In Examples 1 through 3, the statements are either verifiable or based on subjective beliefs, yet the prompt consistently labels them as "No". This indicates that the prompt needs to better differentiate between factual claims and opinions or statements that require context for verification. Additionally, the lack of a clear distinction between different types of claims (e.g., factual vs. opinion-based) leads to incorrect classifications.']

Consider the credibility of the speaker, the verifiability of the statement, and the nature of the claim (whether it is subjective or factual). Provide your judgment with reasoning if possible. When evaluating the statement, take into account the following factors:

- The accuracy of the factual claims based on available evidence or historical context.
- The role and expertise of the speaker in relation to the statement.
- The complexity and specificity of the claim, which may require deeper knowledge or context.
- The nature of the statement—whether it is a matter of professional practice, subjective opinion, or a straightforward factual claim.
- The potential for exaggeration or misrepresentation, even if the statement is not entirely false.

For statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context, consider the plausibility of the claim and the likelihood of it being true or false based on general knowledge or common sense. If the statement is likely to be false based on available evidence or expert opinion, classify it as a lie. If the statement is an opinion or a matter of professional practice that cannot be definitively verified or refuted from the given context, consider the plausibility and the potential for misrepresentation.,

The prompt should emphasize the importance of factual accuracy over the credibility of the speaker unless there is clear reason to doubt their reliability.", "In Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the statements are either unsupported by evidence or lack verifiable facts, yet the prompt seems to prioritize the speaker's role and context over the actual content of the statement. This approach can lead to incorrect predictions if the statement itself is demonstrably false or misleading, even if the speaker is credible in other contexts.", "The prompt might also be too lenient on statements that are highly speculative or anecdotal, as seen in Example 8, where the statement about Barack Obama's law requiring health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws is unfounded. The prompt should require a higher standard of evidence for claims that cannot be easily verified, especially when they make sweeping legal or policy assertions.", 'Another potential issue is that the prompt does not clearly define what constitutes a lie versus a misleading statement. In cases like Example 7, where the statement about water usage and customer growth is potentially exaggerated but not outright false, the prompt should differentiate between a lie and an exaggeration or misrepresentation.', 'Lastly, the prompt may not adequately address the complexity of verifying certain statements, particularly those involving scientific claims or statistical data. For example, in Example 3, the statement about noncitizen voting rates would require checking official statistics, which might be difficult without access to comprehensive data.

In Example 3, the speaker's job title is missing, and they are not associated with a political party, yet their statement about playing in a snowy game is clearly false. The prompt might not have considered the improbability of the event itself, leading to a misclassification.", 'The prompt might also fail to recognize the context in which the statement is made. In Example 6, the statement about criticizing the rush to war is likely true, as the speaker was indeed known for his stance on the Iraq War. However, the prompt’s rigid evaluation process might not have allowed for this historical context, leading to a mislabeling.', "In Example 7, the statement about 14 percent of noncitizens being registered to vote is false, but the prompt might not have considered the broader context of voter registration laws and the likelihood of such a statistic being accurate. The prompt's focus on the speaker's credibility and job might have overshadowed the inherent implausibility of the statement itself.", 'Lastly, the prompt might not have adequately accounted for the medium through which the statement is made. In Example 8, the statement about the Amber Alert program being shut down due to the government shutdown is false, but the medium (Twitter) might not have been considered in the evaluation process.

This highlights a potential issue with how the prompt interprets the context and its impact on evaluating the truthfulness of a statement.', "Example 3 involves a statement about the New York Times' reporting on Donald Trump's tax returns. If the statement is that the Times did not highlight any wrongdoing until a later paragraph, it might be true but not necessarily a lie. The prompt might have missed this nuance, leading to a misclassification.", 'Example 4 is about a conspiracy theory regarding Barack Obama’s alleged unconstitutional actions.

This indicates a need for the prompt to better handle conspiracy theories and extreme claims.', "In Example 7, the statement about the price of Slim Jims changing is likely false, but the prompt might have failed to recognize this due to the context being from a trusted publication like Newsweek.

  feedbacks: ['The prompt fails to consider the context and additional information provided, instead focusing solely on the statement itself. For example, in Example 1, the statement about President Obama firing more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined is factually incorrect, but the context does not indicate any specific historical or factual basis for evaluating the statement, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'The prompt does not properly account for the job title and party affiliation, which can provide important context. In Example 4, the statement about Alex Sinks\' plans for governor including $12.5 billion in new spending would typically be considered true if he were actually running for governor, thus the prediction should be "Yes."', 'The prompt overlooks the nature of the statement being evaluated. In Example 3, the statement is a personal anecdote and not a claim that needs to be verified factually, making it inappropriate to label it as a lie without further context or evidence.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are inherently subjective or opinion-based versus factual claims. In Example 5, the statement about inmate conditions is a factual claim that requires verification, whereas the prediction suggests it is not a lie, indicating a misinterpretation of the task.', 'The prompt lacks clarity on how to handle statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. In Example 2, the statement about conservatives returning their census forms is an opinion or statistical claim that cannot be definitively verified from the provided context alone, leading to an incorrect prediction.', "The prompt does not adequately consider the context and additional information provided, such as the speaker's job title, political party, and the specific context of the statement. For example, in Example 1, the statement about the Democratic senators being for a bicycle tailgating bill contradicts the given information that the speaker is a Republican state delegate. The prompt should ensure that the prediction considers all provided details to accurately assess the truthfulness of the statement.", 'The prompt may be too simplistic, failing to account for the complexity of political statements and their potential for hyperbole or exaggeration. In Example 3, the statement about black America being the 15th wealthiest nation is likely an exaggeration meant to convey a broader point rather than a literal claim. The prompt needs to recognize such rhetorical devices and their context.', 'The prompt might not effectively handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or generalizations, which can be difficult to verify outright. In Example 4, the statement about birthright citizenship is a factual claim that requires detailed knowledge and verification, which the current prompt does not seem to address adequately.', 'The prompt lacks the ability to discern between accurate statements and those that are factually correct but misleading due to selective presentation of data. Example 7, where the statement attributes a significant portion of the deficit increase to President Bush’s policies, might be factually true but still misleading without the full context of economic factors. The prompt should aim to understand the complete picture before labeling a statement as false.', "The prompt does not consider the speaker's credibility or the source of the statement, which can significantly affect the accuracy of the claim. In Example 6, Chris Jacobs, who is a local politician, is making a claim about the state government's handling of tax revenues. The prompt should evaluate such claims based on the speaker's authority and the plausibility of the statement within the given context.", "The prompt may be too simplistic and lacks context-specific nuance required to accurately evaluate the truthfulness of statements. It fails to consider factors such as the speaker's role, the specific context of the statement, and the reliability of the source, which are crucial in determining the accuracy of claims.", 'The prompt\'s binary "lie" or "not lie" classification may not be appropriate for all statements, particularly those that are ambiguous or require additional research to verify. The presence of incomplete or missing information (e.g., job title, state, party) can further complicate the evaluation process, leading to incorrect classifications.', 'The prompt does not specify how to handle statements that are partially true but contain inaccuracies. In such cases, the overall statement might still be considered a lie, but the prompt\'s straightforward "lie" or "not lie" approach does not capture this complexity.', 'The prompt might be incorrectly identifying statements as lies due to its reliance on a binary "lie or not" framework without considering the context or verifiability of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be an exaggeration but not necessarily a lie, especially without evidence to support the claim or refute it. The prompt should account for the possibility that some statements might be exaggerated or inaccurate but not outright false.', "Another issue might be the lack of consideration for the source's credibility or expertise. In Example 4, the statement about income tax distribution is a complex economic claim that requires specialized knowledge to verify. Without additional context about the speaker's expertise or evidence provided, the prompt might incorrectly label the statement as a lie due to its complexity and potential inaccuracy.", 'The prompt could also be struggling with statements that contain partial truths or mixed information. In Example 6, the statement about census return rates might be partially true but also misleading. The prompt needs to evaluate the overall truthfulness of the statement rather than just focusing on specific parts.', 'The prompt does not provide enough context-specific knowledge to evaluate the accuracy of the statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about mental health provisions having over 90 votes in the Senate is factually incorrect, but without specific knowledge about recent Senate votes on such issues, the model cannot determine this from the given context alone.', 'The prompt may not be accounting for the nuances in political discourse and policy interpretation. In Example 2, the statement about unemployment numbers is a factual claim that requires data verification. Without access to real-time or historical unemployment data, the model cannot accurately assess the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt lacks the ability to understand complex relationships between different entities and economic policies. In Example 3, the statement about tax deductions for charitable donations is likely incorrect based on known tax laws, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to recognize this without additional training on tax law specifics.', 'The prompt does not consider the historical context of military practices and legal decisions. In Example 4, the statement about waterboarding during the Philippine revolution is historically inaccurate, but the model may not have sufficient historical context to make this determination without explicit training on historical events.', "The prompt fails to consider the reliability of the sources and the accuracy of the claims within the statements. For example, in Example 1, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker is likely false due to known facts about political funding, but the model did not identify this correctly. Similarly, in Example 3, the claim about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is factually incorrect, yet the model failed to recognize it.", 'The prompt may not be designed to handle statements that require specialized knowledge or that are based on outdated or incorrect assumptions. For instance, in Example 5, the statement about waterboarding being decided as torture back then is historically inaccurate, but the model might not have the correct historical context to assess this claim. This issue is also present in Example 7, where the exact number of deaths due to the American slave trade is a well-established historical fact, which the model might not know.', 'The prompt might not be correctly interpreting the nature of the statements due to a lack of specificity in determining what constitutes a "lie." Statements like the one in Example 3, which involves media coverage and potential bias, require a nuanced understanding of journalistic practices and political influence, which the current prompt does not capture effectively.', 'The prompt may not be adequately considering the source of the statement, such as the medium or platform through which it was disseminated. Examples like Example 7, where a statement is made during a county commission meeting, might be more likely to be accurate compared to a statement made on a satirical show. The prompt should take into account the credibility and reliability of the source in its evaluation.', "In Example 2, the price change of Slim Jims could be a factual error without additional verification, especially if the context suggests the statement was made without recent price checks. The prompt's failure to account for potential recent changes in pricing could lead to the incorrect prediction.", 'Example 3’s statement about counting state budget shortfalls might be a subjective or opinion-based claim rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt may not adequately distinguish between factual claims and opinions, leading to a misclassification.', 'In Example 4, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is likely false given the unique nature of professional sports teams and their tax status. The prompt might not effectively capture the nuances of such specific factual claims.', 'Example 5’s statement about campaign contributions from electric utilities could be a factual claim that requires verification, but the prompt might not prompt the necessary due diligence to ensure the statement is accurate. This could result in an incorrect classification.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the retirement fund that requires verification against financial records or official reports. The prompt should include a step to research and cross-check such claims with available data before making a judgment.', 'For Example 4, the statement about employment law needs to be checked against existing labor laws and regulations. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify legal and regulatory claims against authoritative sources.', 'In Example 5, the price increase of Slim Jims is a factual claim that requires checking against retail prices or company records. The prompt should include a step to research and confirm such claims with reliable market data.', "In some cases, the prompt may have failed to distinguish between statements that require factual verification and those that do not. For example, in Example 2, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes is a specific claim that can be fact-checked against Toomey's public records or policy positions. The prompt might have incorrectly assumed that such a statement would be verified within the context of the press release.", 'The prompt might have underestimated the complexity of evaluating statements made by political figures in various contexts. In Example 3, the statement about Milwaukee having the second-highest number of children recovered from sex trafficking is a statistical claim that requires rigorous data validation. The prompt’s reliance on the speaker’s role and the context alone may not be sufficient to determine the veracity of such a specific and verifiable statement.', 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly specify how to handle factual claims versus opinions or statistical assertions. In Examples 1-8, the statements are either factual claims or statistical assertions that can be objectively verified, yet the predictions are incorrect. This suggests the classifier might be too lenient in accepting statements as true without sufficient evidence or context.', "The prompt does not adequately address the role of expert opinion in certain contexts. In Example 5, the statement about the New York Times' coverage of Donald Trump's tax returns is a matter of journalistic practice and editorial judgment, which may not be easily verifiable through simple factual checks. The prompt should consider the nature of the statement more carefully, especially when it pertains to professional standards or practices.", 'The prompt may not be robust enough to handle subjective claims or personal anecdotes. In Example 7, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is a factual claim that can be verified independently. However, if the statement is based on a personal anecdote or an opinion, the classifier might incorrectly label it as a lie due to its subjective nature. The prompt needs to better distinguish between factual claims and subjective opinions.', 'In Examples 3 and 4, the statements involve political figures making claims about disapproval ratings and water usage, which are matters of public record and can be fact-checked. The prompt should clarify that statements made by politicians or public officials, particularly those involving measurable outcomes like approval ratings or economic indicators, should be evaluated based on available data rather than subjective judgment.', "In Example 8, the statement about voting on tax increases is a specific action that can be verified through official records. The prompt should include instructions to treat such claims as factual assertions that need to be checked against official records, rather than evaluating them based on the speaker's position or the context of the statement.", 'The prompt may have failed to correctly identify lies due to its reliance on subjective judgment and the lack of specific criteria for evaluating the credibility and verifiability of statements. In Example 1, the statement about playing in a game with significant snowfall might be considered plausible given the context of ESPN, which often covers extreme weather events. The prompt might not have sufficiently accounted for the context and the possibility of such events occurring, leading to a misjudgment.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about healthcare costs, which can be complex and subjective. The prompt might not have adequately considered the complexity of healthcare policies and the potential biases in political messaging, leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 5 pertains to tax statistics, which require detailed verification. The prompt might not have included steps for cross-referencing data sources or checking against official reports, leading to an incorrect judgment.', "Example 3 involves a historical fact regarding the American slave trade, which is well-documented and widely accepted. The prompt's failure to recognize this established historical truth highlights a potential issue with how it evaluates factual claims, especially when they are supported by substantial evidence and academic consensus.", 'Example 5 involves a specific claim about the Obama administration\'s actions regarding missile defense facilities, which is likely to be a complex and detailed policy matter. The prompt\'s failure to predict "Yes" indicates it might not have adequately evaluated the credibility of the statement based on the context and the speaker\'s role, leading to an incorrect assessment of the statement\'s veracity.', 'The prompt fails to adequately consider the context and source of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the Milwaukee County Executive\'s statement about state budget shortfalls is likely credible and verifiable, thus should be labeled as "No". Similarly, in Example 2, the Mayor\'s claim about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is specific and verifiable, hence should also be labeled as "No". These examples suggest that the prompt may be too skeptical of official statements without proper verification.', 'The prompt does not sufficiently account for the speaker\'s credibility and the nature of the claim. In Example 3, the statement is a conspiracy theory attributed to a conservative website, which is known for spreading misinformation. Therefore, the label "Yes" is correct. The same applies to Example 4, where the statement is attributed to a Republican, aligning with their tendency to spread false narratives about the Obama administration. The prompt needs to consider the reliability of the source and the political leanings of the speaker.', 'The prompt may be overly critical of statements made by officials, particularly those from opposing parties. In Example 7, the statement about the death tax is a political narrative and may contain inaccuracies, but it is not necessarily a lie. The prompt should balance skepticism with recognition that political rhetoric can contain exaggerations and misrepresentations. Example 8 shows the same issue, where the statement about unemployment numbers is likely a simplification or selective reporting of data, and labeling it as a lie is too harsh.', 'In Example 2, the statement about The New York Times not pointing out wrongdoing until paragraph 18 can be evaluated based on the content of the article, which may be publicly available for verification. The prompt could benefit from guiding the classifier to seek out such evidence.', "Example 3 involves a highly specific historical claim about hydrogen sulfide's use in the Holocaust, which is a well-documented event. The classifier should be encouraged to consider the historical accuracy and consensus of expert sources when evaluating such claims.", 'Example 4 relates to a political claim about birthright citizenship, a topic with clear legal definitions and precedents. The classifier should be prompted to consider the established legal framework and authoritative sources when assessing the truthfulness of such statements.', 'In Example 5, the statement about unemployment numbers would be verifiable through official government statistics. The classifier needs to be guided to check against reliable data sources to determine the accuracy of such claims.', "The prompt might also be too lenient on statements that are highly speculative or anecdotal, as seen in Example 8, where the statement about Barack Obama's law requiring health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws is unfounded. The prompt should require a higher standard of evidence for claims that cannot be easily verified, especially when they make sweeping legal or policy assertions.", 'The prompt could be too rigid in its approach to evaluating statements, particularly when dealing with complex issues like budget shortfalls or economic policies. Statements in these areas can be nuanced and subject to interpretation, and a blanket "yes" or "no" label might not capture the full complexity of the situation. Providing more context-specific guidance could improve accuracy.', "Another reason for incorrect labeling could be the prompt’s emphasis on the speaker's job title, party affiliation, and credibility. In Example 3, the speaker's job title is missing, and they are not associated with a political party, yet their statement about playing in a snowy game is clearly false. The prompt might not have considered the improbability of the event itself, leading to a misclassification.", 'The prompt might also fail to recognize the context in which the statement is made. In Example 6, the statement about criticizing the rush to war is likely true, as the speaker was indeed known for his stance on the Iraq War. However, the prompt’s rigid evaluation process might not have allowed for this historical context, leading to a mislabeling.', "In Example 7, the statement about 14 percent of noncitizens being registered to vote is false, but the prompt might not have considered the broader context of voter registration laws and the likelihood of such a statistic being accurate. The prompt's focus on the speaker's credibility and job might have overshadowed the inherent implausibility of the statement itself.", 'Lastly, the prompt might not have adequately accounted for the medium through which the statement is made. In Example 8, the statement about the Amber Alert program being shut down due to the government shutdown is false, but the medium (Twitter) might not have been considered in the evaluation process. Statements made on social media often require more scrutiny, and the prompt might have missed this nuance.', 'In Example 2, the statement about the American slave trade causing millions of deaths is a well-documented historical fact, yet the prompt might have deemed it not a lie due to the context being a satirical show rather than a serious news broadcast. This highlights a potential issue with how the prompt interprets the context and its impact on evaluating the truthfulness of a statement.', "Example 3 involves a statement about the New York Times' reporting on Donald Trump's tax returns. If the statement is that the Times did not highlight any wrongdoing until a later paragraph, it might be true but not necessarily a lie. The prompt might have missed this nuance, leading to a misclassification.", 'Example 4 is about a conspiracy theory regarding Barack Obama’s alleged unconstitutional actions. The prompt might have struggled with classifying such statements as lies without clear evidence, especially when they are presented by a conservative website. This indicates a need for the prompt to better handle conspiracy theories and extreme claims.'] items,
