The context and job title should help determine if the statement is plausible based on the speaker’s likely knowledge or interest.", 'The prompt lacks consideration for the reliability of the source, especially in cases where the statement is from a partisan source. For example, in Example 4, the mayor’s statement about investment might be true but is incorrectly labeled as a lie because the source is a Democrat, while the label “Yes” implies it is true.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In Example 4, the statement about starting 20 points behind and ending 20 points ahead is more likely to be an opinion or anecdotal evidence rather than a factual claim, which the prompt incorrectly labels as false.', 'The prompt lacks specificity regarding the reliability of the information provided. In Example 5, the statement about inmate conditions is made in a guest column, which may lack rigorous fact-checking. The prompt should consider the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity.', "The prompt does not take into account the expertise or role of the speaker when evaluating the statement's truthfulness. In Example 7, a state delegate making a statement about legislation would be expected to have some knowledge of the issue, but the prompt does not weigh this factor in its assessment.", 'The prompt does not address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements, especially in opinion pieces or media commentary. In Example 8, the statement comparing the wealth of black America to a country is likely exaggerated for rhetorical effect rather than intended to convey a precise statistical fact. The prompt should recognize such rhetorical devices when evaluating the truthfulness of statements.', "The examples suggest that the model might be influenced by the speaker's political affiliation or role, leading it to incorrectly judge statements as true or false. For instance, statements from Republican candidates are sometimes incorrectly labeled as lies, possibly due to a bias against their party.", 'The context provided in the examples might not always contain enough information to determine the truthfulness of the statement. The model might be making assumptions based on the type of media or the speaker’s role, rather than evaluating the statement itself for factual correctness.', 'The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to consider the source of the statement or the nature of the context when determining if a statement is a lie. This lack of direction may cause the model to rely more on the content of the statement itself, potentially missing nuances in the context that could affect its veracity.', 'The model might be too literal in interpreting the phrase "determine if the statement is a lie," leading it to focus solely on the content of the statement without considering the broader implications or the reliability of the source. This could result in incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with statements that might be controversial but not necessarily false.', 'The prompt may be too simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the statements. It assumes that any statement contradicting commonly held beliefs or statistical facts is a lie, without considering the context, evidence, and reliability of the source. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be based on credible research, but the prompt does not allow for such nuance.', 'The prompt does not consider the possibility of misleading or hyperbolic language in the statements. In Example 3, the claim about birthright citizenship might be a simplification or exaggeration for effect, which the prompt interprets as a lie without considering the intent behind the statement.', "The prompt does not consider the context in which the statement was made. In Example 7, the statement about New Jersey's tenure law reform might be accurate within the context of the speech, but the prompt does not allow for this contextual understanding. The context is crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement."] items,

However, the prompt treats all statements equally without considering the speaker's domain expertise.", 'Examples 3 and 8 involve statistical claims about mortality rates and historical events, respectively. These types of claims often require rigorous data validation, which might not be immediately apparent from the given context. The prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to seek out additional verification for such claims.', 'In Examples 4 and 5, the statements concern government actions and public opinion trends. Given the high stakes and often complex nature of these topics, the reliability of the statement can be influenced by the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. The prompt does not adequately address the need to consider the broader implications and sources of information in these cases.', 'Examples 7 and 8 highlight statements that are either factually incorrect or exaggerated for comedic effect.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be too rigid in its approach to evaluating statements, leading to misjudgments. It instructs to consider the source, context, and potential exaggeration but does not provide clear guidance on how to balance these factors. In Example 1, the statement about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes might be true in certain jurisdictions but is likely false in others, especially given the complexity of tax laws. The prompt’s blanket assumption that the statement is false without further investigation led to the incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 2, the statement about cancer and kidney failure killing more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya is plausible due to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in many African countries. However, the prompt’s focus on factual correctness without acknowledging the possibility of valid statistical claims led to the incorrect prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the Obama administration and the Amber Alert program. While it is factually incorrect that the Amber Alert program was shut down during a government shutdown, the prompt’s emphasis on evaluating the speaker’s role and political affiliation might have overshadowed the need to check the factual accuracy, leading to the wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 is about a personal experience involving snow during a football game. The statement is likely exaggerated or a hyperbole, common in sports commentary. The prompt’s strict adherence to evaluating factual correctness without considering rhetorical devices and personal accounts led to the incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the narrowing of insurance options under the Affordable Care Act is complex and context-dependent. While the prompt acknowledges the influence of the speaker’s role, it does not provide a method to verify such claims accurately, leading to the incorrect prediction. The statement might be true in specific regions or demographics, but the prompt did not allow for this nuance.']
LLM feedbacks size:  5
LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have failed to recognize the specific context and nature of the statements due to a lack of detailed instruction on how to evaluate statements that are known to be hyperbole or exaggerations for rhetorical effect. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about playing in a game with 23 inches of snow is likely meant as a figure of speech rather than a literal fact, yet the prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to distinguish between literal and figurative language.', "In Example 3, the statement about throwing away shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an overstatement for emphasis, and the prompt might not have adequately addressed the need to consider the simplification and exaggeration often used in public figures' statements for dramatic effect. The classifier may have incorrectly assumed the statement was a factual recommendation.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about tax contributions, which is a complex economic issue that can be misleading without proper context. The prompt should include guidance on recognizing statistical claims and their potential misinterpretation, especially when made by politicians with a particular agenda.', 'For Example 6, the statement about Slim Jims costing more is a straightforward price change, but the prompt may not have sufficiently emphasized the importance of verifying recent price changes, especially in rapidly changing markets like consumer goods.', 'In Example 7, the statement about The New York Times not pointing out wrongdoing until a later paragraph is likely a critique of journalistic practices, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt needs to clarify that some statements are critiques or opinions and should not be evaluated solely based on factual accuracy.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be overly cautious, leading to a tendency to label statements as "No" when they are actually "Yes". This is evident in Examples 1 through 4, where the prompt incorrectly labels statements as not being lies. The prompt\'s instruction to consider the "possible influence of the speaker\'s role, political affiliation, or the medium through which the statement was made" might be interpreted as a reason to doubt the statement, even if it aligns with known facts or historical data.', 'The prompt does not adequately address how to handle statements that are partially true but misleading due to exaggeration or simplification. In Examples 3, 5, and 7, the statements are simplified or exaggerated, but the prompt does not provide clear guidance on how to evaluate such claims, leading to incorrect "No" predictions.', 'The prompt\'s instruction to "Evaluate the statement for factual correctness, taking into account the possible influence of the speaker\'s role, political affiliation, or the medium through which the statement was made" might lead evaluators to prioritize political context over factual accuracy, resulting in incorrect judgments. For instance, in Example 6, the statement about tax contributions is factually correct, but the prompt\'s emphasis on political influence might cause evaluators to doubt its accuracy.', 'The prompt lacks specificity in how to handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or personal experiences, which can be difficult to verify. In Example 2, the statement about out-of-state gasoline purchases is likely an opinion or a generalization, and the prompt does not provide clear instructions on how to evaluate such statements, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'The prompt\'s instruction to "Do not assume the statement is false just because it contradicts common knowledge or your personal beliefs" might be misinterpreted as a directive to always label statements as "No" if they seem implausible. This can lead to incorrect "No" predictions in cases like Example 8, where the statement about the Amber Alert program shutdown is plausible and aligns with known events, but the prompt\'s caution might cause evaluators to doubt its accuracy.']
LLM feedbacks size:  5
LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and the credibility of the sources when evaluating the statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about illegal immigration is likely a misrepresentation of facts, yet the prompt does not adequately address how political rhetoric can distort reality. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about the Bush administration writing checks to General Motors without conditions is a known falsehood, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker’s role and context might not fully capture the historical and factual inaccuracies involved.', 'In Example 3, the statement about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more is factually incorrect; however, the prompt’s emphasis on the medium and the speaker’s role might overshadow the need for a rigorous factual check. This oversight leads to a wrong prediction, as the statement is demonstrably false despite its source or context.', 'Example 4 involves a price change for a product, which can fluctuate due to market dynamics and supply chain issues. The prompt’s evaluation might not adequately account for such practical and temporal changes, leading to a misclassification of the statement as a lie when it is simply an outdated claim.', 'In Example 5, the tax benefits for charitable donations are complex and vary widely depending on the amount donated and the donor’s specific circumstances. The prompt’s approach might not appropriately handle nuanced financial claims, especially when the source is a public figure like a former White House Press Secretary, whose statements could be intended to highlight perceived injustices rather than being strictly factually accurate.', 'Example 6 likely refers to a misconception about mercury exposure from CFL bulbs, which is a common myth. The prompt’s focus on the source and context might not effectively counteract such misinformation, leading to an incorrect classification of the statement as true when it is actually a widespread misconception.']

This lack of context and detail leads to incorrect classifications.', "The prompt does not take into consideration the historical context or the specific details provided in the context. For instance, in Example 1, the claim about Donald Trump's disapproval ratings might be true or false depending on when it was made. Similarly, in Example 5, the claim about noncitizens voting would be false if it refers to a time when noncitizens were not allowed to vote, but the prompt does not provide enough information to make this determination.", "The prompt does not account for the political leanings or affiliations of the speaker, which can influence the accuracy of their claims. In Examples 2, 3, and 6, the statements are attributed to individuals from the opposing party, which might lead to a bias in the prediction. The prompt should consider the alignment between the speaker's party and the content of the statement.", 'The prompt lacks an understanding of the specific fields or domains in which the statements are made.

The prompt needs to recognize the type of statement being made and the expertise required to verify it.', 'The prompt does not address the reliability of the source or the potential for misinformation. In Example 7, the statement about the retirement fund not being funded might be a deliberate misrepresentation or a misunderstanding.

In Example 3, the statement about Donald Trump's disapproval ratings being second-highest would require checking actual polling data, which might not align with what a senator claims. Similarly, Example 4 about the Koch brothers' donations would need a detailed financial audit rather than a simple yes/no judgment.", 'The prompt fails to distinguish between factual statements and opinions or beliefs. Statements like the one in Example 7 about the retirement fund not being funded are subjective unless verified against official records.

Example 6 about cancer and kidney failure deaths in Kenya might be correct at the time of the speech but could change due to new medical research or policy changes. The classifier should be aware that some statements may be true at the moment but become outdated quickly.', 'The prompt does not handle statistical claims effectively.

In Example 8, the statement about the Koch brothers giving more money to Scott Walker is likely to be true based on public records, but the context from a Democrat's speech might lead to skepticism.

In Example 2, the statement about tax deductions for charitable donations is a generalized claim that may not hold true in all cases. However, given the context of a former White House Press Secretary making a statement, the claim should be evaluated against actual policies and not just general knowledge.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it fails to consider the complexity and specificity of the statements in relation to the available information. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the retirement fund for public employees being unfunded might be true based on specific circumstances not reflected in the context of a general press conference. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about throwing away shoes after mercury exposure could be accurate based on scientific evidence not mentioned in the legislative hearing context. The prompt needs to better account for the nuances and specific contexts that might validate such claims.', 'The prompt also lacks sensitivity to the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about child sex trafficking in Milwaukee might be accurate according to reliable data sources not mentioned in the context. The governor’s statement alone does not necessarily make it a lie without additional evidence suggesting otherwise. The prompt should consider the credibility of the source more carefully.', 'The prompt might be too quick to dismiss statements that align with common beliefs or political narratives. In Example 4, the statement about Donald Trump’s disapproval ratings might be accurate based on widely reported polls, which were not referenced in the context. The prompt should allow for the possibility that common political narratives can sometimes reflect reality, especially when verified by independent data.', 'The prompt may not adequately weigh the accuracy of the information against the context and available data. In Example 5, the statement about out-of-state gasoline purchases might be accurate based on detailed economic data that was not provided in the interview context. The prompt should ensure that it evaluates the statement against verifiable facts rather than just the context provided.', 'The prompt might not effectively handle statements that align with historical events or known facts. In Example 6, the statement about the absence of successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during a specific period is likely accurate based on historical records, which were not mentioned in the speech context. The prompt should take into account the broader historical context to better evaluate such claims.']
LLM feedbacks size:  5
LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly relies on the reliability of the source and the alignment with commonly accepted facts without considering the specific context and the nature of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about playing in a snowy game is plausible within the context of ESPN sports commentary, despite the improbability of such a scenario. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about not voting for tax increases aligns with the job title and context of a U.S. Senate debate, making it reasonable to consider it truthful.', "In Example 3, the statement about the Amber Alert program being shut down due to a government shutdown contradicts historical facts, yet the prompt might overlook this if it heavily weighs the context and source reliability. The prompt's focus on commonly accepted facts should be balanced with an ability to recognize outright inaccuracies, especially when they conflict with well-established historical events.", 'Example 4 involves a price change, which can fluctuate due to various market factors. The prompt might not adequately account for such dynamic information, leading to a misjudgment. The statement could be true if the price increase occurred recently and was reported accurately, even though it seems unlikely.', 'In Example 5, the statement about water usage growth is specific and quantitative. The prompt might not fully evaluate the plausibility and supporting evidence for such claims, focusing instead on the source’s credibility and the general context. This oversight could lead to an incorrect judgment, as the claim about water usage growth might be verifiable through official records.', 'Example 6 discusses gasoline purchases, which can vary widely based on local economies and consumer behavior. The statement is specific and could be true if supported by reliable data. The prompt might not effectively assess the statistical accuracy and relevance of such claims, leading to a misclassification.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not clearly define how to assess the accuracy of information, especially in the absence of specific factual data or verifiable claims. It relies heavily on the alignment with commonly accepted facts, which can be subjective and varies based on the individual’s beliefs and biases. This ambiguity leads to inconsistent judgments across different statements.', "The prompt might also be failing to account for the source's expertise relevant to the statement. In some cases, a source might have specialized knowledge that makes their statement more reliable, even if it contradicts general knowledge. For instance, in Example 3, the State Senate Minority Leader's statement about gasoline purchases in Virginia might be based on accurate internal data, making it true despite conflicting with general assumptions.", "The prompt's reliance on political biases can lead to biased judgments. Statements from politicians of opposing parties might be incorrectly labeled as false due to preconceived notions rather than factual analysis. In Example 4, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker is a factual claim that requires verification, not a judgment based on political affiliation.", 'The prompt might not adequately consider the context and medium through which the statement was made. In Example 6, the claim about the Amber Alert program being shut down during a government shutdown might be based on misinformation or a misunderstanding, but without additional context, the prompt would label it as false without considering the possibility of miscommunication or error.', 'The prompt may lack a mechanism to handle statements that are partially true or require nuance. Examples like Example 1 and Example 7 involve statements that might be partially true or context-dependent, requiring a more nuanced approach to evaluation rather than a binary "yes" or "no" response. The current prompt does not account for this complexity, leading to incorrect labels.']

The prompt might overlook the accuracy of the statement in favor of the speaker's political stance.", "In Example 2, the statement about the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of federal taxes is a factual claim that can be verified against tax data. The prompt might not adequately consider the verifiability of the information provided by the source, instead focusing too much on the source's political affiliation.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of context-specific accuracy. "Romneycare" refers to healthcare reform in Massachusetts, which is different from the national context. The prompt might not sufficiently account for regional differences and the specificity of the context when evaluating the statement\'s accuracy.', 'Example 4 involves the statement about firing employees. While it might be true in certain contexts, the prompt might not consider the specific legal framework or company policies that could vary, leading to a blanket "no" prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about job creation under Republican and Democratic administrations is a complex economic claim that requires detailed data analysis.

  feedbacks: ['The prompt fails to consider the credibility of the source or the context in which the statement is made. For instance, in Example 1, the context does not relate to the statement about President Obama firing missiles, yet the prediction is incorrect. The prompt should take into account whether the speaker or writer has expertise or access to accurate information relevant to the claim.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are false and those that are simply not verifiable with the given information. In Example 7, the statement about the ZIP code being the second-most gentrified might be true but cannot be verified without additional data, so it should not be labeled as a lie.', "The prompt does not account for political biases that might influence the statement's accuracy. In Example 5, the statement aligns with a Republican perspective but is still labeled as a lie. The context and job title should help determine if the statement is plausible based on the speaker’s likely knowledge or interest.", 'The prompt lacks consideration for the reliability of the source, especially in cases where the statement is from a partisan source. For example, in Example 4, the mayor’s statement about investment might be true but is incorrectly labeled as a lie because the source is a Democrat, while the label “Yes” implies it is true.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In Example 4, the statement about starting 20 points behind and ending 20 points ahead is more likely to be an opinion or anecdotal evidence rather than a factual claim, which the prompt incorrectly labels as false.', 'The prompt lacks specificity regarding the reliability of the information provided. In Example 5, the statement about inmate conditions is made in a guest column, which may lack rigorous fact-checking. The prompt should consider the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity.', "The prompt does not take into account the expertise or role of the speaker when evaluating the statement's truthfulness. In Example 7, a state delegate making a statement about legislation would be expected to have some knowledge of the issue, but the prompt does not weigh this factor in its assessment.", 'The prompt does not address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements, especially in opinion pieces or media commentary. In Example 8, the statement comparing the wealth of black America to a country is likely exaggerated for rhetorical effect rather than intended to convey a precise statistical fact. The prompt should recognize such rhetorical devices when evaluating the truthfulness of statements.', "The examples suggest that the model might be influenced by the speaker's political affiliation or role, leading it to incorrectly judge statements as true or false. For instance, statements from Republican candidates are sometimes incorrectly labeled as lies, possibly due to a bias against their party.", 'The context provided in the examples might not always contain enough information to determine the truthfulness of the statement. The model might be making assumptions based on the type of media or the speaker’s role, rather than evaluating the statement itself for factual correctness.', 'The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to consider the source of the statement or the nature of the context when determining if a statement is a lie. This lack of direction may cause the model to rely more on the content of the statement itself, potentially missing nuances in the context that could affect its veracity.', 'The model might be too literal in interpreting the phrase "determine if the statement is a lie," leading it to focus solely on the content of the statement without considering the broader implications or the reliability of the source. This could result in incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with statements that might be controversial but not necessarily false.', 'The prompt may be too simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the statements. It assumes that any statement contradicting commonly held beliefs or statistical facts is a lie, without considering the context, evidence, and reliability of the source. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be based on credible research, but the prompt does not allow for such nuance.', 'The prompt does not consider the possibility of misleading or hyperbolic language in the statements. In Example 3, the claim about birthright citizenship might be a simplification or exaggeration for effect, which the prompt interprets as a lie without considering the intent behind the statement.', "The prompt does not consider the context in which the statement was made. In Example 7, the statement about New Jersey's tenure law reform might be accurate within the context of the speech, but the prompt does not allow for this contextual understanding. The context is crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement.", "In Examples 2 and 6, the statements pertain to specific policy areas (insurance options and campaign finance) that the speakers (U.S. Representative and U.S. Representative) might be knowledgeable about, potentially making their opinions more credible. However, the prompt treats all statements equally without considering the speaker's domain expertise.", 'Examples 3 and 8 involve statistical claims about mortality rates and historical events, respectively. These types of claims often require rigorous data validation, which might not be immediately apparent from the given context. The prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to seek out additional verification for such claims.', 'In Examples 4 and 5, the statements concern government actions and public opinion trends. Given the high stakes and often complex nature of these topics, the reliability of the statement can be influenced by the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. The prompt does not adequately address the need to consider the broader implications and sources of information in these cases.', 'Examples 7 and 8 highlight statements that are either factually incorrect or exaggerated for comedic effect. The prompt should include a consideration for the medium (e.g., a satirical news show) and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration, especially when the context suggests a lighter tone or entertainment value.', 'In Example 2, the price change of Slim Jims is a specific factual claim that can be verified through market data or company records. The prompt might have overlooked the possibility of such claims needing empirical evidence rather than just considering the reliability of the source.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the financial impact of cancer, which could be a complex issue requiring detailed analysis and data. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as false without considering the possibility that the statement, though exaggerated, could be based on credible sources or studies, especially if the speaker has relevant expertise.', "In Example 4, the statement about the New York Times article might require a thorough review of the article itself, including checking if there were any earlier mentions of wrongdoing. The prompt might have failed to consider the need for a deeper analysis of the source material beyond just the speaker's job title.", "Example 5 about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is a factual claim that could be verified through public records. The prompt might have overlooked the importance of verifying such claims independently rather than relying solely on the speaker's role as a politician.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of historical accuracy. The statement about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more may be a simplified or exaggerated claim. The prompt should take into account the broader implications and the potential for hyperbole in historical claims, especially when presented in a satirical context like "The Daily Show."', "Example 4 involves a statement about budget shortfalls made by someone with a specific job title and political affiliation. The prompt may not fully appreciate the complexity of budget processes and the role of local officials in managing state finances. It should consider the credibility of the speaker's position and their potential influence on budget decisions.", "Example 5 deals with a statement about Donald Trump’s disapproval ratings, which can be highly politicized and subject to rapid changes. The prompt may not adequately account for the dynamic nature of public opinion and the influence of political campaigns on perceived approval ratings. It should consider the context of the statement and the speaker's motivation in making such a claim.", 'In Example 2, the statement about cancer and kidney failure killing more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya is plausible due to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in many African countries. However, the prompt’s focus on factual correctness without acknowledging the possibility of valid statistical claims led to the incorrect prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the Obama administration and the Amber Alert program. While it is factually incorrect that the Amber Alert program was shut down during a government shutdown, the prompt’s emphasis on evaluating the speaker’s role and political affiliation might have overshadowed the need to check the factual accuracy, leading to the wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 is about a personal experience involving snow during a football game. The statement is likely exaggerated or a hyperbole, common in sports commentary. The prompt’s strict adherence to evaluating factual correctness without considering rhetorical devices and personal accounts led to the incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the narrowing of insurance options under the Affordable Care Act is complex and context-dependent. While the prompt acknowledges the influence of the speaker’s role, it does not provide a method to verify such claims accurately, leading to the incorrect prediction. The statement might be true in specific regions or demographics, but the prompt did not allow for this nuance.', 'The prompt may have failed to recognize the specific context and nature of the statements due to a lack of detailed instruction on how to evaluate statements that are known to be hyperbole or exaggerations for rhetorical effect. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about playing in a game with 23 inches of snow is likely meant as a figure of speech rather than a literal fact, yet the prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to distinguish between literal and figurative language.', "In Example 3, the statement about throwing away shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an overstatement for emphasis, and the prompt might not have adequately addressed the need to consider the simplification and exaggeration often used in public figures' statements for dramatic effect. The classifier may have incorrectly assumed the statement was a factual recommendation.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about tax contributions, which is a complex economic issue that can be misleading without proper context. The prompt should include guidance on recognizing statistical claims and their potential misinterpretation, especially when made by politicians with a particular agenda.', 'In Example 7, the statement about The New York Times not pointing out wrongdoing until a later paragraph is likely a critique of journalistic practices, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt needs to clarify that some statements are critiques or opinions and should not be evaluated solely based on factual accuracy.', 'The prompt does not adequately address how to handle statements that are partially true but misleading due to exaggeration or simplification. In Examples 3, 5, and 7, the statements are simplified or exaggerated, but the prompt does not provide clear guidance on how to evaluate such claims, leading to incorrect "No" predictions.', 'The prompt lacks specificity in how to handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or personal experiences, which can be difficult to verify. In Example 2, the statement about out-of-state gasoline purchases is likely an opinion or a generalization, and the prompt does not provide clear instructions on how to evaluate such statements, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'The prompt\'s instruction to "Do not assume the statement is false just because it contradicts common knowledge or your personal beliefs" might be misinterpreted as a directive to always label statements as "No" if they seem implausible. This can lead to incorrect "No" predictions in cases like Example 8, where the statement about the Amber Alert program shutdown is plausible and aligns with known events, but the prompt\'s caution might cause evaluators to doubt its accuracy.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and the credibility of the sources when evaluating the statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about illegal immigration is likely a misrepresentation of facts, yet the prompt does not adequately address how political rhetoric can distort reality. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about the Bush administration writing checks to General Motors without conditions is a known falsehood, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker’s role and context might not fully capture the historical and factual inaccuracies involved.', 'Example 4 involves a price change for a product, which can fluctuate due to market dynamics and supply chain issues. The prompt’s evaluation might not adequately account for such practical and temporal changes, leading to a misclassification of the statement as a lie when it is simply an outdated claim.', 'In Example 5, the tax benefits for charitable donations are complex and vary widely depending on the amount donated and the donor’s specific circumstances. The prompt’s approach might not appropriately handle nuanced financial claims, especially when the source is a public figure like a former White House Press Secretary, whose statements could be intended to highlight perceived injustices rather than being strictly factually accurate.', 'Example 6 likely refers to a misconception about mercury exposure from CFL bulbs, which is a common myth. The prompt’s focus on the source and context might not effectively counteract such misinformation, leading to an incorrect classification of the statement as true when it is actually a widespread misconception.', 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in how to evaluate the truthfulness of statements. It does not provide clear guidelines on how to assess the credibility of the information provided in the context, job title, state, and party. This ambiguity allows the classifier to make incorrect judgments based on incomplete or irrelevant information.', 'The examples suggest that the classifier might be overly literal or not considering the broader implications or historical context. For instance, in Example 2, the statement is about past actions and legal decisions, which might not reflect current policy positions. The classifier should consider the temporal and contextual aspects of the statement.', 'The prompt does not specify how to handle statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In many cases, the classifier seems to treat opinions as lies if they do not align with the current or expected position of the politician. This misalignment can lead to incorrect predictions, as it conflates opinion with fact.', 'The examples indicate that the classifier might be failing to recognize the nuances in language use, such as hyperbole or sarcasm. Statements that exaggerate or use rhetorical devices might be incorrectly classified as false. The prompt needs to include guidance on how to interpret such language accurately.', 'The prompt lacks an understanding of the specific fields or domains in which the statements are made. Statements about economic data, such as job creation numbers in Example 2, require a different level of scrutiny than statements about military or political actions. The prompt needs to recognize the type of statement being made and the expertise required to verify it.', 'The prompt does not address the reliability of the source or the potential for misinformation. In Example 7, the statement about the retirement fund not being funded might be a deliberate misrepresentation or a misunderstanding. Without considering the source’s reliability and the possibility of intentional deception, the prompt cannot accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.', "The prompt does not account for the complexity and specificity required to evaluate statements accurately. It treats all statements as equally verifiable, which can lead to incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with niche or less-known facts. For example, the mercury disposal statement requires specific knowledge about environmental health, while the Koch brothers' donations to political candidates involve detailed financial records that may not be readily available or accurate without proper verification.", "The prompt lacks context sensitivity, particularly in recognizing the source of information and the reliability of the speaker. In Example 3, the statement about Donald Trump's disapproval ratings being second-highest would require checking actual polling data, which might not align with what a senator claims. Similarly, Example 4 about the Koch brothers' donations would need a detailed financial audit rather than a simple yes/no judgment.", 'The prompt does not consider the dynamic nature of information, such as changing conditions or recent events. Example 6 about cancer and kidney failure deaths in Kenya might be correct at the time of the speech but could change due to new medical research or policy changes. The classifier should be aware that some statements may be true at the moment but become outdated quickly.', 'The prompt does not handle statistical claims effectively. Statements involving numbers, like the one in Example 2 about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more, require historical research and data analysis. Without proper validation, the classifier might incorrectly judge a statement as false based on its own limited understanding of historical facts.', "The prompt does not adequately consider the expertise of the speaker. For instance, in Example 1, a lawyer stating that living in different state districts does not matter when running for Congress should be considered a lie due to the speaker's professional knowledge, even though the context does not explicitly contradict the statement. The current prompt does not account for such domain-specific information.", 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinion-based versus those that can be verified. In Examples 3 and 4, the statements about the Affordable Care Act and mercury exposure are matters of fact that can be verified through data and expert opinion, rather than personal beliefs. The current prompt treats all statements equally without considering their verifiability.', 'The prompt also lacks sensitivity to the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about child sex trafficking in Milwaukee might be accurate according to reliable data sources not mentioned in the context. The governor’s statement alone does not necessarily make it a lie without additional evidence suggesting otherwise. The prompt should consider the credibility of the source more carefully.', 'The prompt might not effectively handle statements that align with historical events or known facts. In Example 6, the statement about the absence of successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during a specific period is likely accurate based on historical records, which were not mentioned in the speech context. The prompt should take into account the broader historical context to better evaluate such claims.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly relies on the reliability of the source and the alignment with commonly accepted facts without considering the specific context and the nature of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about playing in a snowy game is plausible within the context of ESPN sports commentary, despite the improbability of such a scenario. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about not voting for tax increases aligns with the job title and context of a U.S. Senate debate, making it reasonable to consider it truthful.', 'In Example 5, the statement about water usage growth is specific and quantitative. The prompt might not fully evaluate the plausibility and supporting evidence for such claims, focusing instead on the source’s credibility and the general context. This oversight could lead to an incorrect judgment, as the claim about water usage growth might be verifiable through official records.', 'Example 6 discusses gasoline purchases, which can vary widely based on local economies and consumer behavior. The statement is specific and could be true if supported by reliable data. The prompt might not effectively assess the statistical accuracy and relevance of such claims, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt's reliance on political biases can lead to biased judgments. Statements from politicians of opposing parties might be incorrectly labeled as false due to preconceived notions rather than factual analysis. In Example 4, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker is a factual claim that requires verification, not a judgment based on political affiliation.", "In Example 2, the statement about the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of federal taxes is a factual claim that can be verified against tax data. The prompt might not adequately consider the verifiability of the information provided by the source, instead focusing too much on the source's political affiliation.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of context-specific accuracy. "Romneycare" refers to healthcare reform in Massachusetts, which is different from the national context. The prompt might not sufficiently account for regional differences and the specificity of the context when evaluating the statement\'s accuracy.', 'Example 4 involves the statement about firing employees. While it might be true in certain contexts, the prompt might not consider the specific legal framework or company policies that could vary, leading to a blanket "no" prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about job creation under Republican and Democratic administrations is a complex economic claim that requires detailed data analysis. The prompt might not effectively handle the nuance of such claims, especially when they involve long-term trends and multiple factors influencing job creation.'] items,

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately distinguish between factual claims and opinions, especially when the speaker has a specific role or job title. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about people having active Social Security numbers at 112 years of age is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on available data rather than the speaker's role as a U.S. Senator. The prompt should emphasize the importance of verifying such claims through reliable sources.", 'In Example 2, the statement about not raising taxes is more of an opinion or policy stance rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt needs to better differentiate between factual claims and statements of opinion, especially in political contexts. The prediction of "No" might be inappropriate if the statement is simply expressing a personal or organizational viewpoint without providing verifiable evidence.', 'Example 3 involves a statement regarding the workload of Supreme Court justices, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors. The prompt should recognize that some statements might be more interpretive and less susceptible to straightforward verification. In this case, the prediction of "No" might be incorrect because the statement reflects an interpretation of court activity rather than a definitive fact.', 'Example 4 discusses public opinion polls, which are inherently subjective and can vary over time. The prompt should consider that some statements might reflect broader trends or attitudes rather than verifiable facts. The prediction of "No" might be incorrect if the statement is accurately reflecting ongoing changes in public opinion.', 'In Example 5, the statement about Hillary Clinton’s popularity is a matter of opinion and public perception, not a verifiable fact. The prompt should recognize that statements about political standing or public approval are often based on subjective measures rather than concrete data. The prediction of "Yes" might be incorrect if the statement is accurately reflecting the speaker\'s opinion or perception.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately account for the nature of historical statements or the context of opinion pieces. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Ben Franklin is a well-known historical anecdote, and the job title and context do not change its status as a widely accepted fact. Similarly, in Example 3, the statement about running for the U.S. Senate is a personal decision that does not require factual verification, and thus should be labeled as not a lie. The prompt needs to recognize that some statements are based on personal beliefs or historical facts rather than verifiable claims.', "In Examples 2 and 8, the prompt might have incorrectly labeled the statements as lies due to an overemphasis on the source's potential bias. However, the statements themselves are not necessarily false; they are simply opinions or observations without requiring factual corroboration. The prompt needs to better distinguish between factual claims and subjective opinions, especially when the source is a public figure expressing their views.", 'Examples 4 and 5 involve statements that are either comparative or historical in nature. In Example 4, the statement about Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of interpretation and trend analysis, which may be true or false based on available data. In Example 5, the statement about Republican politicians becoming Democrats is a factual claim that can be verified through records, but the prompt does not seem to consider the possibility of such changes. The prompt should include a more nuanced approach to evaluating comparative and historical claims.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the prompt might have mislabeled these statements due to a lack of clear criteria for distinguishing between factual claims and assertions based on subjective beliefs or political agendas. The statement about America being number one in oil and gas is a factual claim that can be verified, while the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is a subjective opinion. The prompt needs to provide clearer guidelines on how to differentiate between these types of claims.', "Examples 1 and 3 highlight the need for the prompt to better handle statements that are not directly verifiable but are commonly known or accepted facts. The statement about Ben Franklin's quote in Example 1 is a well-established piece of trivia, and the statement about running for the U.S. Senate in Example 3 is a personal choice without a specific factual basis. The prompt should recognize that some statements are based on widely recognized truths or personal decisions, which do not require rigorous fact-checking."]

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need to evaluate the reliability of the source and the context, which can sometimes lead to overlooking the factual accuracy of statements, especially when they are directly related to the speaker's role or job title. For instance, in Example 1, the U.S. senator's statement about wanting to be vice president is a direct expression of intent, which should be considered truthful unless there is concrete evidence to the contrary. Similarly, in Example 6, a governor's statement about not raising taxes aligns with their role and responsibilities, making it less likely to be false without additional context suggesting otherwise.", 'The prompt might also be too cautious about hyperbole or exaggeration, potentially leading to over-evaluation of such elements at the expense of more straightforward claims. In Example 2, the statement about the Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a factual claim that does not require extensive contextual analysis; it can be evaluated based on available data. Overanalyzing the context and source reliability in such cases can result in misjudgments.', 'Another reason could be the lack of clear guidance on how to handle statements that are clearly opinions versus factual claims. In Example 3, the statement about Latino support for the DREAM Act is an opinion, and the fact that Marco Rubio opposes it is a factual claim. The prompt might not have provided enough clarity on distinguishing between these types of statements, leading to confusion and incorrect labeling.', 'The prompt might also fail to consider the specific nature of the context, such as the medium or platform where the statement is made. In Example 5, the statement about baseball and insurance being exempt from antitrust laws is a factual claim that can be verified through legal sources, regardless of the context or medium. The prompt’s emphasis on the type of publication or platform might have led to overlooking the verifiability of the statement.', 'Lastly, the prompt could be too focused on the broader implications and the credibility of the information, which might not always be relevant to simple factual claims. In Example 8, the statement about Obamacare not forcing people out of their health plans is a factual claim that can be verified against the actual provisions of the law. The prompt’s emphasis on broader implications might have led to a misjudgment of the statement’s truthfulness based on assumptions rather than factual verification.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt overly emphasizes the need to consider the reliability of the source and context, which can sometimes lead to overcaution in judging statements. For example, in Example 1, the U.S. Senator\'s claim about Social Security numbers being issued to people 112 years old might seem implausible, but without clear evidence, it should be labeled as "No" rather than "Yes." The prompt\'s cautionary approach may have caused the model to incorrectly label this as a lie.', "In Example 2, the prompt's focus on the credibility of polling data might have led to an incorrect classification. While the poll has a history of inaccuracy, the statement itself is not necessarily false; it is more about the reliability of the poll, which the prompt does not handle well. The model might have misinterpreted this as a factual claim rather than recognizing it as a statement about past performance.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about personal intentions, which the prompt seems to classify as a lie, possibly due to its phrasing. However, the statement is a hypothetical question ("On whether he wants to be vice president"), and it\'s not appropriate to label such a question as a lie. The prompt\'s strict criteria for evaluating truthfulness might have led to an incorrect label.', "In Example 4, the statement about judges' benefits is a factual claim that requires specific verification. The prompt's emphasis on broader implications and context might have caused the model to overlook the need for fact-checking. Given the limited information provided, the statement could be true or false, and a more direct approach to verifying the claim would be necessary.", "Example 5 refers to a historical fact about President Obama, which the prompt might have incorrectly classified as a lie due to the lack of direct evidence in the context. However, given that President Obama did not receive paychecks from profitmaking businesses, the statement is factually correct. The prompt's tendency to err on the side of caution might have led to a misclassification."]

Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the speaker's expertise or role, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect. Evaluate the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, taking into account the potential influence of political campaigns, the type of publication or platform where the statement is made, and the availability of verifiable facts. 

To ensure accuracy, follow these specific steps:
1. **Verify Factual Claims**: Check if the statement aligns with known facts and evidence. If a statement cannot be verified with reliable sources, it should be classified as a lie.
2. **Assess Source Credibility**: Consider the reputation, expertise, and potential biases of the source. A statement from a reputable source with relevant expertise is more likely to be credible.
3. **Evaluate Context**: Understand the context in which the statement is made. Personal experiences or opinions expressed in a subjective manner may not require the same level of factual verification as claims made in a professional or public setting.
4. **Consider Rhetorical Devices**: Recognize when statements are using hyperbole, exaggeration, or rhetorical devices for effect. These may not necessarily indicate a lie but can influence perception.
5. **Check for Political Influence**: Be aware of the potential impact of political campaigns or affiliations on the statement's credibility. Statements made during political contexts may require additional scrutiny.
6. **Analyze Publication Type**: Different types of publications or platforms (e.g., news articles, social media posts, opinion pieces) may have varying levels of credibility. Assess the nature of the publication in relation to the statement.
7. **Review Historical Data**: For statements related to historical events or past actions, review relevant documents, records, and verified historical accounts to ensure accuracy.
8. **Cross-Reference Information**: Use multiple sources to verify the statement. Consistent information across various reliable sources increases the likelihood of the statement being true.
9. **Consider the Implications**: Evaluate the broader implications of the statement. Misleading information can have significant consequences, so thorough evaluation is crucial.

Provide your judgment with careful consideration of all these factors, ensuring that the reliability of the source and the context are thoroughly evaluated.,

The prompt\'s focus on factual claims versus opinions might lead it to incorrectly judge this as not a lie when it should consider the possibility that the statement is true or partially true.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is likely an opinion or exaggeration rather than a factual claim. However, the prompt might not adequately distinguish between strong opinions and outright falsehoods, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a specific and potentially absurd claim about Social Security numbers. The prompt might not effectively handle such extreme or implausible statements, tending to label them as factual unless explicitly stated otherwise, thus incorrectly predicting "No."', 'In Example 4, the statement about America being No. 1 in oil and gas is a broad claim that might be misleading or exaggerated. The prompt’s caution against hyperbole could be misapplied, leading to an incorrect "No" if it fails to recognize the claim as potentially false due to overgeneralization or lack of context.', 'For Example 5, the statement about a $30 million pot for redistricting is likely false or misleading. The prompt might miss the specific nature of the claim as a false statement if it focuses more on the general credibility of the speaker rather than the veracity of the specific claim.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and reliability of the source in determining the veracity of statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement is factually correct according to the context provided, and the source is a senior adviser to the president, which adds credibility. The prompt's caution about hyperbole or exaggeration might have led to misjudgment, overlooking the factual accuracy due to the potential for such rhetoric.", "In Example 2, the source is from an organization opposing same-sex marriage, which might bias the statement. The prompt should consider the source's potential bias and align the judgment more closely with the context, recognizing that the source might not always present balanced views.", "Example 3 involves a claim about Social Security numbers, which can be verified through official audits. The prompt's focus on broader implications and credibility might lead to overlooking the specific verifiability of such claims, especially when they pertain to official records.", "Example 4 involves a claim about political party changes, which can often be true but require specific evidence. The prompt's caution against hyperbole might cause it to dismiss the statement without considering the possibility that such changes can indeed occur, especially if backed by credible sources.", "Example 5 involves a claim about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists. While this is a serious accusation, the prompt's approach to evaluating the credibility of the source (a presidential candidate) might lead to an overcautious stance, potentially missing the significance of the claim given the source's position."]

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not adequately distinguish between factual claims and statements that express opinions or hypothetical scenarios. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Ben Franklin's quote is a factual claim about historical knowledge, which is generally considered reliable without needing further verification. However, the prediction is incorrect, suggesting that the prompt might be too cautious in labeling such statements as lies. The prompt should recognize that some historical quotes are well-established and not easily debatable.", 'In Examples 2 through 6, the statements are about specific actions or claims made by public figures regarding their policies or experiences. These are typically factual claims that can be verified through official records or other sources. The prompt might be failing to consider the verifiability of such statements, leading to incorrect predictions. It should focus more on the verifiability of the claims rather than assuming they are false without evidence.', "Example 7 involves a statement about the potential impact of a bill on the school year. This is a hypothetical scenario that requires analysis of the bill's language and context, rather than a simple yes/no lie determination. The prompt should account for the need to analyze the implications and details of the statement rather than treating all statements as straightforward factual claims.", "Example 8 deals with a statement about the stability of public opinion on a social issue. Public opinion polls can change over time, but the statement itself is not necessarily false if the pollster's data shows no significant change. The prompt might be overly critical of statements that reflect ongoing trends or public sentiment, failing to recognize that such statements can be true even if they do not represent dramatic changes.", "The prompt's approach to determining whether a statement is a lie or not seems to lack a clear threshold for what constitutes a lie. In some cases, like Examples 1 and 7, the statements are more nuanced and require contextual understanding rather than a binary lie/no lie decision. The prompt should clarify the criteria for what qualifies as a lie to better align with the nature of the statements being evaluated."]

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the nature of the statement itself, particularly when it involves policy claims or legal facts. For instance, in Example 4, the statement about Social Security numbers being held by individuals at an impossible age is a factual claim that can be objectively verified, which the current prompt might overlook in favor of considering the speaker's role or the context of the news release. A more nuanced approach would evaluate the plausibility and verifiability of the claim directly.", 'In Examples 5 and 6, the statements pertain to specific industries and court practices, which require specialized knowledge to evaluate. The current prompt does not explicitly account for the expertise or role of the speaker in relation to the subject matter of the statement. The Milwaukee County Sheriff in Example 2 would likely have less relevant experience in baseball regulations or antitrust laws, but the current prompt does not adequately address how to weigh such factors.', 'Examples like 7 and 8 involve statements about historical actions or policy positions that can be fact-checked against historical records or official documents. The current prompt focuses more on the speaker’s credibility and the context rather than the verifiability of the claim itself. A more effective approach would include a step to research and verify the factual accuracy of the statement, regardless of the speaker’s background or the context of the statement.', 'The prompt does not adequately distinguish between statements that are inherently subjective (opinions) and those that are objective (factual claims). In Examples 3 and 7, the lack of a clear statement of fact means the prediction should lean towards “Yes” as these are more about intentions or personal history rather than verifiable truths. The current prompt may need to include a criterion for distinguishing between opinion and fact, especially in cases where the statement is ambiguous.', 'In Examples 1 and 8, the context and the reliability of the source are critical. The House Majority Leader in Example 1 is a significant political figure, and their statement about the stimulus bill failing to create jobs would be considered more credible than a casual claim. Similarly, the senior adviser to President Obama in Example 8 would have a high level of credibility regarding the implementation of Obamacare. The current prompt does not sufficiently weight the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be overly focused on evaluating the reliability of the source and the context, which can sometimes lead to dismissing factual statements made by credible individuals, especially in political or media contexts. For example, in Example 1, the statement is factually correct despite being made by a senior adviser to the President, which suggests the prompt might unduly prioritize the source's reputation over the content of the statement.", "In Example 2, the statement is also factually accurate, and the context does not suggest any reason to doubt its veracity. However, the prompt might be too skeptical of statements made by politicians, leading to incorrect judgments. The focus on the context and the source's role should be balanced with a more careful examination of the actual content of the statement.", "Example 3 involves a statement about a serious and controversial topic (Donald Trump and terrorism). While it's possible that the statement could be false, the prompt might be too quick to assume it without proper verification, especially given the high stakes involved. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to evaluating statements on sensitive topics.", "In Example 4, the statement seems to be a factual claim about political careers, but the lack of a job title, state, and party in the context might have led to a misinterpretation. The prompt should consider the nature of the statement itself more closely, rather than relying solely on external factors like the source's identity or the context.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about the workload of Supreme Court justices. While the context is an interview, which might typically be less reliable, the statement itself appears to be a factual claim about judicial caseloads. The prompt might be too dismissive of factual claims in interviews, failing to give due consideration to the verifiability of the statement.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly distinguish between statements that are factual claims and those that are opinions or rhetorical questions. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about political party changes among specific individuals could be seen as a factual claim, but the prompt might interpret it as an opinion or a rhetorical statement without sufficient evidence. This lack of clarity can lead to incorrect judgments.', "In Example 2, the statement about wanting to be vice president is a direct question rather than a factual claim, which the prompt might interpret as a statement that needs verification. The job title and context do not necessarily imply that such a question must be false; hence, the prompt's prediction might be incorrect.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about President Obama’s financial history, which is a factual claim. The context in an MSNBC discussion might not provide enough evidence to verify this claim definitively. The prompt might not adequately account for the difficulty in verifying such historical claims, leading to a wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 relates to a claim about the status of high-speed rail, which is a factual statement. However, the context of a speech at a Democratic convention might not provide enough evidence to confirm or deny this claim, making it difficult for the prompt to make a reliable judgment.', "Example 5 concerns the accuracy of a statement about students skipping math classes in Oregon. This could be a factual claim or a sensationalized report. The context being a blog post from an Illinois-based blogger might not offer enough evidence to verify the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction based on the prompt's guidelines."]

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not sufficiently account for the nuances in political context and the specific roles of individuals. For instance, in Example 1, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's statement about balancing budgets or turning back surpluses is more likely to be a factual claim within the scope of their duties, even if not entirely accurate. The prompt should consider the speaker's role and the likelihood of them making such claims as part of their job responsibilities.\n\nIn Example 3, the statement regarding the 2009 stimulus bill failing to get people back to work is a complex economic issue. While the House Majority Leader might have a political bias, the statement could still be factually incorrect based on various economic analyses and data, which the prompt should take into account more effectively.\n\nExample 4 involves a teacher-blogger claiming students are skipping math to learn about the Bible. This statement is more likely to be an opinion or exaggeration rather than a factual claim, especially without supporting evidence or context. The prompt needs to better distinguish between factual claims and opinions, particularly in the context of blogs.\n\nExample 5 involves a columnist making a historical claim about political party changes among certain Republicans. Columnists often make broad, sometimes inaccurate generalizations, and the prompt should be more critical of such statements, especially when there is no clear verification of the facts.\n\nExample 6 regarding the history of Crimea is a well-established historical fact. The national security commentator for CNN, despite being a Republican, should not be expected to misrepresent such basic historical information. The prompt needs to be more rigorous in evaluating the veracity of widely known facts.", "The prompt may have failed to recognize that some statements are more likely to be opinions or exaggerations, especially those made in informal settings like blog posts or personal comments. In Example 4, the teacher-blogger's statement about students skipping math is more of an opinion or a dramatization rather than a factual claim. The prompt should be more adept at differentiating between factual claims and subjective opinions, particularly in informal or opinion-based media.\n\nIn Example 5, the online comment from a columnist is more likely to be an opinion or a misinformed statement rather than a verifiable fact. Columnists often express opinions or make claims without providing evidence, and the prompt should be more aware of this tendency.\n\nExample 6 involves a historical fact that is widely accepted and taught, making it less likely to be a misstatement. The national security commentator's statement about Crimea’s history should be evaluated against established historical records, and the prompt should reflect this understanding.\n\nIn Example 7, the statement about Wisconsin Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of record. The lack of a job title, state, and party does not change the fact that the statement can be verified through official court records. The prompt should be more focused on verifying claims against reliable sources rather than relying on the speaker’s credentials or affiliations.\n\nExample 8 is about a legal fact regarding antitrust exemptions, which is a well-known and documented aspect of U.S. law. The statement made in a television advertisement should be evaluated against established legal facts, and the prompt should be more adept at recognizing such well-established truths.", "The prompt may have failed to adequately consider the context and reliability of the source in determining the accuracy of the statement. In Example 1, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's statement about budget balances is more likely to be a factual claim related to their job responsibilities, despite potential inaccuracies. The prompt should weigh the speaker's role and the plausibility of the claim more carefully.\n\nIn Example 3, the statement about the stimulus bill is a complex economic issue. The House Majority Leader might have a political agenda, but the statement itself could be factually incorrect based on economic data and analysis. The prompt should be more nuanced in evaluating the credibility of political statements, especially those involving economic policy.\n\nExample 4 involves a teacher-blogger's claim about students skipping math. This statement is more likely to be an opinion or a dramatization rather than a factual claim.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need to verify factual claims through independent sources, which can be challenging or unnecessary in some contexts. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists might be based on classified intelligence or other sources not immediately accessible, making it difficult to verify without risking national security. Similarly, in Example 2, the claim about the Katy Freeway's width might be a hyperbolic statement meant to emphasize a point rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt should allow for the possibility that some statements, especially those made in a rhetorical or dramatic context, may not require rigorous verification.", "The prompt might also be too rigid in its approach to opinions versus factual claims. In Examples 3 and 4, the statements are more about policy positions or personal experiences rather than clear-cut facts. The Governor's statement about judges' benefits might reflect their perspective on public policy, while the claim about President Obama's business history is more about his past actions and financial disclosures. The prompt should recognize that sometimes statements are more about subjective beliefs or policy stances, which might not always be easily verifiable but still need to be considered in the context of the speaker's role and expertise.", "The prompt could be too focused on political biases and less on the reliability of the source and the nature of the context. In Examples 5 and 6, the statements are made in the context of political conventions or press statements, which often reflect the speaker's party affiliation and agenda. However, the prompt's emphasis on political biases might lead to misjudging the credibility of the statement based solely on the speaker's party, rather than evaluating the statement's content and context more comprehensively.", "In Examples 7 and 8, the statements are about specific local events or conditions that might not be widely known or verifiable without local knowledge. The statement about the 21st State Senate district being created in secret for a specific person might be based on insider information or rumors, while the claim about students skipping math class to learn about the Bible might be anecdotal or exaggerated. The prompt should allow for a more nuanced evaluation of such statements, considering the source's local expertise and the potential for rumor or exaggeration.", "The prompt might also be too cautious about hyperbole and exaggeration, which can be common in certain contexts like interviews or speeches. In Examples 1 and 8, the statements might be hyperbolic or used for rhetorical effect rather than literal truth. The prompt should recognize that such statements, while not factually accurate, can still be part of the broader narrative or argument being made and should be evaluated in the context of the speaker's intent and the overall discussion."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define what constitutes a factual claim versus an opinion. In Examples 1, 2, and 7, the statements are factual claims about specific conditions or statistics that can be verified independently, but the prompt did not lead to the correct classification. It should emphasize the importance of verifying such claims through reliable sources.', 'In Examples 3 and 8, the statements are self-referential and relate to personal intentions or desires rather than verifiable facts. The prompt should include a clear distinction between statements of intent and factual claims, as these do not require verification and are generally considered opinions.', 'Examples 4 and 5 involve claims that are either too specific or lack sufficient context to verify. The prompt should address how to handle claims that are difficult to verify due to their specificity or the limited available information, guiding the classifier to rely more heavily on the nature of the statement itself.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the statements present information that is either demonstrably false or has been shown to be inaccurate. The prompt needs to include a mechanism for recognizing and flagging such claims, even if they cannot be verified immediately, based on known facts or logical inconsistencies.', 'The job titles, states, and parties provided in the examples do not always align with the content of the statements, leading to confusion.

For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Obamacare is a known fact within the political context, and the prediction should reflect this established truth rather than requiring additional verification.", "The prompt might also be overly cautious about political biases without considering the speaker's credibility or the context. In Example 2, the statement from the Milwaukee County Sheriff about balancing budgets or turning back surpluses could be seen as a political claim rather than a factual one, and the prediction should reflect the likelihood of such claims being true or false based on the speaker's role and the context, rather than just the potential for bias.", 'The prompt could be missing the nuance required to distinguish between strong opinions and factual claims. In Example 3, the statement about being No. 1 in child hunger could be interpreted as a strong opinion rather than a factual claim, especially given the lack of specific details. The prediction should consider the nature of the statement more carefully, recognizing that some statements can be subjective or opinion-based.', 'In Example 4, the statement about the word "progressive" being a substitute for "communist" might be a widely known fact or a common political argument. The prompt might need to account for such well-known claims that don\'t necessarily require independent verification, especially when they align with known political narratives.', 'The prompt might not adequately handle statements that are self-referential or hypothetical, like the one in Example 5 regarding wanting to be vice president.

Similarly, in Example 2, the President making a political statement during a campaign rally should be evaluated with caution but not outright dismissed without considering the broader context and political implications. The prompt needs to be more nuanced in handling statements from high-ranking officials and those in positions of power.", 'The prompt focuses heavily on verifying factual claims through independent sources, which can lead to overlooking the possibility that some statements are opinions rather than factual claims.

The prompt should include a clear distinction between factual claims and opinions to avoid mislabeling such statements.', 'The prompt does not adequately account for the use of hyperbole or exaggeration for rhetorical effect, especially in statements made by politicians. Examples 1 and 6 involve statements that are likely exaggerated for political gain, and the prompt should include a specific clause to evaluate such rhetoric critically.', 'The prompt lacks specific guidance on how to handle statements that are inherently subjective or based on personal beliefs, such as those made by the Executive Director in Example 5 regarding public opinion on same-sex marriage. The prompt should include criteria for distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions, especially when dealing with statements made by individuals without a clear expertise in the subject matter.', "The prompt does not sufficiently address the complexity of political biases and the potential for statements to be influenced by them, as seen in Examples 2 and 8.

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the role and expertise of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect. Verify factual claims through independent sources when possible. Account for potential political biases and the speaker's position. Analyze the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, taking into account the complexity and nuances of the situation. 

To handle statements that are opinions versus factual claims, recognize that opinions are subjective and reflect personal beliefs or perspectives, and should not be classified as lies unless they are demonstrably false. For factual claims, ensure that you seek corroboration from reliable sources before making a determination. 

For statements that present information that is either demonstrably false or has been shown to be inaccurate, flag them accordingly, even if immediate verification is not possible. If a statement cannot be verified and lacks supporting evidence, consider it a lie. 

When evaluating factual claims, especially those related to specific policies, programs, or statistics, verify the claim directly rather than relying solely on broader context or implications. 

In cases where the statement contradicts commonly held beliefs or statistical facts, consider the possibility that the belief or fact may be outdated or incorrect, and seek additional evidence to support your judgment. Do not assume that all contradictory statements are lies without proper investigation.

Remember to balance the need for verification with the potential for misinformation and the importance of maintaining a nuanced understanding of the situation.,

  feedbacks: ['The prompt fails to consider the credibility of the source or the context in which the statement is made. For instance, in Example 1, the context does not relate to the statement about President Obama firing missiles, yet the prediction is incorrect. The prompt should take into account whether the speaker or writer has expertise or access to accurate information relevant to the claim.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are false and those that are simply not verifiable with the given information. In Example 7, the statement about the ZIP code being the second-most gentrified might be true but cannot be verified without additional data, so it should not be labeled as a lie.', "The prompt does not account for political biases that might influence the statement's accuracy. In Example 5, the statement aligns with a Republican perspective but is still labeled as a lie. The context and job title should help determine if the statement is plausible based on the speaker’s likely knowledge or interest.", 'The prompt lacks consideration for the reliability of the source, especially in cases where the statement is from a partisan source. For example, in Example 4, the mayor’s statement about investment might be true but is incorrectly labeled as a lie because the source is a Democrat, while the label “Yes” implies it is true.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In Example 4, the statement about starting 20 points behind and ending 20 points ahead is more likely to be an opinion or anecdotal evidence rather than a factual claim, which the prompt incorrectly labels as false.', 'The prompt lacks specificity regarding the reliability of the information provided. In Example 5, the statement about inmate conditions is made in a guest column, which may lack rigorous fact-checking. The prompt should consider the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity.', "The prompt does not take into account the expertise or role of the speaker when evaluating the statement's truthfulness. In Example 7, a state delegate making a statement about legislation would be expected to have some knowledge of the issue, but the prompt does not weigh this factor in its assessment.", 'The prompt does not address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements, especially in opinion pieces or media commentary. In Example 8, the statement comparing the wealth of black America to a country is likely exaggerated for rhetorical effect rather than intended to convey a precise statistical fact. The prompt should recognize such rhetorical devices when evaluating the truthfulness of statements.', "The examples suggest that the model might be influenced by the speaker's political affiliation or role, leading it to incorrectly judge statements as true or false. For instance, statements from Republican candidates are sometimes incorrectly labeled as lies, possibly due to a bias against their party.", 'The context provided in the examples might not always contain enough information to determine the truthfulness of the statement. The model might be making assumptions based on the type of media or the speaker’s role, rather than evaluating the statement itself for factual correctness.', 'The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to consider the source of the statement or the nature of the context when determining if a statement is a lie. This lack of direction may cause the model to rely more on the content of the statement itself, potentially missing nuances in the context that could affect its veracity.', 'The model might be too literal in interpreting the phrase "determine if the statement is a lie," leading it to focus solely on the content of the statement without considering the broader implications or the reliability of the source. This could result in incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with statements that might be controversial but not necessarily false.', 'The prompt may be too simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the statements. It assumes that any statement contradicting commonly held beliefs or statistical facts is a lie, without considering the context, evidence, and reliability of the source. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be based on credible research, but the prompt does not allow for such nuance.', 'The prompt does not consider the possibility of misleading or hyperbolic language in the statements. In Example 3, the claim about birthright citizenship might be a simplification or exaggeration for effect, which the prompt interprets as a lie without considering the intent behind the statement.', "The prompt does not consider the context in which the statement was made. In Example 7, the statement about New Jersey's tenure law reform might be accurate within the context of the speech, but the prompt does not allow for this contextual understanding. The context is crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement.", "In Examples 2 and 6, the statements pertain to specific policy areas (insurance options and campaign finance) that the speakers (U.S. Representative and U.S. Representative) might be knowledgeable about, potentially making their opinions more credible. However, the prompt treats all statements equally without considering the speaker's domain expertise.", 'Examples 3 and 8 involve statistical claims about mortality rates and historical events, respectively. These types of claims often require rigorous data validation, which might not be immediately apparent from the given context. The prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to seek out additional verification for such claims.', 'In Examples 4 and 5, the statements concern government actions and public opinion trends. Given the high stakes and often complex nature of these topics, the reliability of the statement can be influenced by the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. The prompt does not adequately address the need to consider the broader implications and sources of information in these cases.', 'Examples 7 and 8 highlight statements that are either factually incorrect or exaggerated for comedic effect. The prompt should include a consideration for the medium (e.g., a satirical news show) and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration, especially when the context suggests a lighter tone or entertainment value.', 'In Example 2, the price change of Slim Jims is a specific factual claim that can be verified through market data or company records. The prompt might have overlooked the possibility of such claims needing empirical evidence rather than just considering the reliability of the source.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the financial impact of cancer, which could be a complex issue requiring detailed analysis and data. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as false without considering the possibility that the statement, though exaggerated, could be based on credible sources or studies, especially if the speaker has relevant expertise.', "In Example 4, the statement about the New York Times article might require a thorough review of the article itself, including checking if there were any earlier mentions of wrongdoing. The prompt might have failed to consider the need for a deeper analysis of the source material beyond just the speaker's job title.", "Example 5 about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is a factual claim that could be verified through public records. The prompt might have overlooked the importance of verifying such claims independently rather than relying solely on the speaker's role as a politician.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of historical accuracy. The statement about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more may be a simplified or exaggerated claim. The prompt should take into account the broader implications and the potential for hyperbole in historical claims, especially when presented in a satirical context like "The Daily Show."', "Example 4 involves a statement about budget shortfalls made by someone with a specific job title and political affiliation. The prompt may not fully appreciate the complexity of budget processes and the role of local officials in managing state finances. It should consider the credibility of the speaker's position and their potential influence on budget decisions.", "Example 5 deals with a statement about Donald Trump’s disapproval ratings, which can be highly politicized and subject to rapid changes. The prompt may not adequately account for the dynamic nature of public opinion and the influence of political campaigns on perceived approval ratings. It should consider the context of the statement and the speaker's motivation in making such a claim.", 'In Example 2, the statement about cancer and kidney failure killing more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya is plausible due to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in many African countries. However, the prompt’s focus on factual correctness without acknowledging the possibility of valid statistical claims led to the incorrect prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the Obama administration and the Amber Alert program. While it is factually incorrect that the Amber Alert program was shut down during a government shutdown, the prompt’s emphasis on evaluating the speaker’s role and political affiliation might have overshadowed the need to check the factual accuracy, leading to the wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 is about a personal experience involving snow during a football game. The statement is likely exaggerated or a hyperbole, common in sports commentary. The prompt’s strict adherence to evaluating factual correctness without considering rhetorical devices and personal accounts led to the incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the narrowing of insurance options under the Affordable Care Act is complex and context-dependent. While the prompt acknowledges the influence of the speaker’s role, it does not provide a method to verify such claims accurately, leading to the incorrect prediction. The statement might be true in specific regions or demographics, but the prompt did not allow for this nuance.', 'The prompt may have failed to recognize the specific context and nature of the statements due to a lack of detailed instruction on how to evaluate statements that are known to be hyperbole or exaggerations for rhetorical effect. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about playing in a game with 23 inches of snow is likely meant as a figure of speech rather than a literal fact, yet the prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to distinguish between literal and figurative language.', "In Example 3, the statement about throwing away shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an overstatement for emphasis, and the prompt might not have adequately addressed the need to consider the simplification and exaggeration often used in public figures' statements for dramatic effect. The classifier may have incorrectly assumed the statement was a factual recommendation.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about tax contributions, which is a complex economic issue that can be misleading without proper context. The prompt should include guidance on recognizing statistical claims and their potential misinterpretation, especially when made by politicians with a particular agenda.', 'In Example 7, the statement about The New York Times not pointing out wrongdoing until a later paragraph is likely a critique of journalistic practices, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt needs to clarify that some statements are critiques or opinions and should not be evaluated solely based on factual accuracy.', 'The prompt does not adequately address how to handle statements that are partially true but misleading due to exaggeration or simplification. In Examples 3, 5, and 7, the statements are simplified or exaggerated, but the prompt does not provide clear guidance on how to evaluate such claims, leading to incorrect "No" predictions.', 'The prompt lacks specificity in how to handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or personal experiences, which can be difficult to verify. In Example 2, the statement about out-of-state gasoline purchases is likely an opinion or a generalization, and the prompt does not provide clear instructions on how to evaluate such statements, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'The prompt\'s instruction to "Do not assume the statement is false just because it contradicts common knowledge or your personal beliefs" might be misinterpreted as a directive to always label statements as "No" if they seem implausible. This can lead to incorrect "No" predictions in cases like Example 8, where the statement about the Amber Alert program shutdown is plausible and aligns with known events, but the prompt\'s caution might cause evaluators to doubt its accuracy.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and the credibility of the sources when evaluating the statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about illegal immigration is likely a misrepresentation of facts, yet the prompt does not adequately address how political rhetoric can distort reality. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about the Bush administration writing checks to General Motors without conditions is a known falsehood, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker’s role and context might not fully capture the historical and factual inaccuracies involved.', 'Example 4 involves a price change for a product, which can fluctuate due to market dynamics and supply chain issues. The prompt’s evaluation might not adequately account for such practical and temporal changes, leading to a misclassification of the statement as a lie when it is simply an outdated claim.', 'In Example 5, the tax benefits for charitable donations are complex and vary widely depending on the amount donated and the donor’s specific circumstances. The prompt’s approach might not appropriately handle nuanced financial claims, especially when the source is a public figure like a former White House Press Secretary, whose statements could be intended to highlight perceived injustices rather than being strictly factually accurate.', 'Example 6 likely refers to a misconception about mercury exposure from CFL bulbs, which is a common myth. The prompt’s focus on the source and context might not effectively counteract such misinformation, leading to an incorrect classification of the statement as true when it is actually a widespread misconception.', 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in how to evaluate the truthfulness of statements. It does not provide clear guidelines on how to assess the credibility of the information provided in the context, job title, state, and party. This ambiguity allows the classifier to make incorrect judgments based on incomplete or irrelevant information.', 'The examples suggest that the classifier might be overly literal or not considering the broader implications or historical context. For instance, in Example 2, the statement is about past actions and legal decisions, which might not reflect current policy positions. The classifier should consider the temporal and contextual aspects of the statement.', 'The prompt does not specify how to handle statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In many cases, the classifier seems to treat opinions as lies if they do not align with the current or expected position of the politician. This misalignment can lead to incorrect predictions, as it conflates opinion with fact.', 'The examples indicate that the classifier might be failing to recognize the nuances in language use, such as hyperbole or sarcasm. Statements that exaggerate or use rhetorical devices might be incorrectly classified as false. The prompt needs to include guidance on how to interpret such language accurately.', 'The prompt lacks an understanding of the specific fields or domains in which the statements are made. Statements about economic data, such as job creation numbers in Example 2, require a different level of scrutiny than statements about military or political actions. The prompt needs to recognize the type of statement being made and the expertise required to verify it.', 'The prompt does not address the reliability of the source or the potential for misinformation. In Example 7, the statement about the retirement fund not being funded might be a deliberate misrepresentation or a misunderstanding. Without considering the source’s reliability and the possibility of intentional deception, the prompt cannot accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.', "The prompt does not account for the complexity and specificity required to evaluate statements accurately. It treats all statements as equally verifiable, which can lead to incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with niche or less-known facts. For example, the mercury disposal statement requires specific knowledge about environmental health, while the Koch brothers' donations to political candidates involve detailed financial records that may not be readily available or accurate without proper verification.", "The prompt lacks context sensitivity, particularly in recognizing the source of information and the reliability of the speaker. In Example 3, the statement about Donald Trump's disapproval ratings being second-highest would require checking actual polling data, which might not align with what a senator claims. Similarly, Example 4 about the Koch brothers' donations would need a detailed financial audit rather than a simple yes/no judgment.", 'The prompt does not consider the dynamic nature of information, such as changing conditions or recent events. Example 6 about cancer and kidney failure deaths in Kenya might be correct at the time of the speech but could change due to new medical research or policy changes. The classifier should be aware that some statements may be true at the moment but become outdated quickly.', 'The prompt does not handle statistical claims effectively. Statements involving numbers, like the one in Example 2 about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more, require historical research and data analysis. Without proper validation, the classifier might incorrectly judge a statement as false based on its own limited understanding of historical facts.', "The prompt does not adequately consider the expertise of the speaker. For instance, in Example 1, a lawyer stating that living in different state districts does not matter when running for Congress should be considered a lie due to the speaker's professional knowledge, even though the context does not explicitly contradict the statement. The current prompt does not account for such domain-specific information.", 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinion-based versus those that can be verified. In Examples 3 and 4, the statements about the Affordable Care Act and mercury exposure are matters of fact that can be verified through data and expert opinion, rather than personal beliefs. The current prompt treats all statements equally without considering their verifiability.', 'The prompt also lacks sensitivity to the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about child sex trafficking in Milwaukee might be accurate according to reliable data sources not mentioned in the context. The governor’s statement alone does not necessarily make it a lie without additional evidence suggesting otherwise. The prompt should consider the credibility of the source more carefully.', 'The prompt might not effectively handle statements that align with historical events or known facts. In Example 6, the statement about the absence of successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during a specific period is likely accurate based on historical records, which were not mentioned in the speech context. The prompt should take into account the broader historical context to better evaluate such claims.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly relies on the reliability of the source and the alignment with commonly accepted facts without considering the specific context and the nature of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about playing in a snowy game is plausible within the context of ESPN sports commentary, despite the improbability of such a scenario. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about not voting for tax increases aligns with the job title and context of a U.S. Senate debate, making it reasonable to consider it truthful.', 'In Example 5, the statement about water usage growth is specific and quantitative. The prompt might not fully evaluate the plausibility and supporting evidence for such claims, focusing instead on the source’s credibility and the general context. This oversight could lead to an incorrect judgment, as the claim about water usage growth might be verifiable through official records.', 'Example 6 discusses gasoline purchases, which can vary widely based on local economies and consumer behavior. The statement is specific and could be true if supported by reliable data. The prompt might not effectively assess the statistical accuracy and relevance of such claims, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt's reliance on political biases can lead to biased judgments. Statements from politicians of opposing parties might be incorrectly labeled as false due to preconceived notions rather than factual analysis. In Example 4, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker is a factual claim that requires verification, not a judgment based on political affiliation.", "In Example 2, the statement about the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of federal taxes is a factual claim that can be verified against tax data. The prompt might not adequately consider the verifiability of the information provided by the source, instead focusing too much on the source's political affiliation.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of context-specific accuracy. "Romneycare" refers to healthcare reform in Massachusetts, which is different from the national context. The prompt might not sufficiently account for regional differences and the specificity of the context when evaluating the statement\'s accuracy.', 'Example 4 involves the statement about firing employees. While it might be true in certain contexts, the prompt might not consider the specific legal framework or company policies that could vary, leading to a blanket "no" prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about job creation under Republican and Democratic administrations is a complex economic claim that requires detailed data analysis. The prompt might not effectively handle the nuance of such claims, especially when they involve long-term trends and multiple factors influencing job creation.', "The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately distinguish between factual claims and opinions, especially when the speaker has a specific role or job title. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about people having active Social Security numbers at 112 years of age is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on available data rather than the speaker's role as a U.S. Senator. The prompt should emphasize the importance of verifying such claims through reliable sources.", 'In Example 2, the statement about not raising taxes is more of an opinion or policy stance rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt needs to better differentiate between factual claims and statements of opinion, especially in political contexts. The prediction of "No" might be inappropriate if the statement is simply expressing a personal or organizational viewpoint without providing verifiable evidence.', 'Example 3 involves a statement regarding the workload of Supreme Court justices, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors. The prompt should recognize that some statements might be more interpretive and less susceptible to straightforward verification. In this case, the prediction of "No" might be incorrect because the statement reflects an interpretation of court activity rather than a definitive fact.', 'Example 4 discusses public opinion polls, which are inherently subjective and can vary over time. The prompt should consider that some statements might reflect broader trends or attitudes rather than verifiable facts. The prediction of "No" might be incorrect if the statement is accurately reflecting ongoing changes in public opinion.', 'The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately account for the nature of historical statements or the context of opinion pieces. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Ben Franklin is a well-known historical anecdote, and the job title and context do not change its status as a widely accepted fact. Similarly, in Example 3, the statement about running for the U.S. Senate is a personal decision that does not require factual verification, and thus should be labeled as not a lie. The prompt needs to recognize that some statements are based on personal beliefs or historical facts rather than verifiable claims.', 'Examples 4 and 5 involve statements that are either comparative or historical in nature. In Example 4, the statement about Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of interpretation and trend analysis, which may be true or false based on available data. In Example 5, the statement about Republican politicians becoming Democrats is a factual claim that can be verified through records, but the prompt does not seem to consider the possibility of such changes. The prompt should include a more nuanced approach to evaluating comparative and historical claims.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the prompt might have mislabeled these statements due to a lack of clear criteria for distinguishing between factual claims and assertions based on subjective beliefs or political agendas. The statement about America being number one in oil and gas is a factual claim that can be verified, while the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is a subjective opinion. The prompt needs to provide clearer guidelines on how to differentiate between these types of claims.', 'The prompt might also be too cautious about hyperbole or exaggeration, potentially leading to over-evaluation of such elements at the expense of more straightforward claims. In Example 2, the statement about the Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a factual claim that does not require extensive contextual analysis; it can be evaluated based on available data. Overanalyzing the context and source reliability in such cases can result in misjudgments.', 'Another reason could be the lack of clear guidance on how to handle statements that are clearly opinions versus factual claims. In Example 3, the statement about Latino support for the DREAM Act is an opinion, and the fact that Marco Rubio opposes it is a factual claim. The prompt might not have provided enough clarity on distinguishing between these types of statements, leading to confusion and incorrect labeling.', 'The prompt might also fail to consider the specific nature of the context, such as the medium or platform where the statement is made. In Example 5, the statement about baseball and insurance being exempt from antitrust laws is a factual claim that can be verified through legal sources, regardless of the context or medium. The prompt’s emphasis on the type of publication or platform might have led to overlooking the verifiability of the statement.', "In Example 2, the prompt's focus on the credibility of polling data might have led to an incorrect classification. While the poll has a history of inaccuracy, the statement itself is not necessarily false; it is more about the reliability of the poll, which the prompt does not handle well. The model might have misinterpreted this as a factual claim rather than recognizing it as a statement about past performance.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about personal intentions, which the prompt seems to classify as a lie, possibly due to its phrasing. However, the statement is a hypothetical question ("On whether he wants to be vice president"), and it\'s not appropriate to label such a question as a lie. The prompt\'s strict criteria for evaluating truthfulness might have led to an incorrect label.', "In Example 4, the statement about judges' benefits is a factual claim that requires specific verification. The prompt's emphasis on broader implications and context might have caused the model to overlook the need for fact-checking. Given the limited information provided, the statement could be true or false, and a more direct approach to verifying the claim would be necessary.", "Example 5 refers to a historical fact about President Obama, which the prompt might have incorrectly classified as a lie due to the lack of direct evidence in the context. However, given that President Obama did not receive paychecks from profitmaking businesses, the statement is factually correct. The prompt's tendency to err on the side of caution might have led to a misclassification.", 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need to consider the reliability of the source and the broader implications, which can lead to misjudging statements that are factually correct but are made by sources that are generally considered less credible. For example, in Example 1, the statement about Crimea is historically accurate, but the source, a national security commentator for CNN, might be seen as less reliable due to their job title and political affiliation, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt's consideration of the broader implications and credibility of the information might lead it to dismiss statements that are factually correct but are made in contexts that are generally viewed as unreliable. In Example 4, the statement about the non-existence of a specific funding pot is factually correct, but the context of a redistricting meeting might make the source seem less credible, resulting in a misclassification.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is likely an opinion or exaggeration rather than a factual claim. However, the prompt might not adequately distinguish between strong opinions and outright falsehoods, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a specific and potentially absurd claim about Social Security numbers. The prompt might not effectively handle such extreme or implausible statements, tending to label them as factual unless explicitly stated otherwise, thus incorrectly predicting "No."', 'In Example 4, the statement about America being No. 1 in oil and gas is a broad claim that might be misleading or exaggerated. The prompt’s caution against hyperbole could be misapplied, leading to an incorrect "No" if it fails to recognize the claim as potentially false due to overgeneralization or lack of context.', 'For Example 5, the statement about a $30 million pot for redistricting is likely false or misleading. The prompt might miss the specific nature of the claim as a false statement if it focuses more on the general credibility of the speaker rather than the veracity of the specific claim.', "In Example 2, the source is from an organization opposing same-sex marriage, which might bias the statement. The prompt should consider the source's potential bias and align the judgment more closely with the context, recognizing that the source might not always present balanced views.", "Example 3 involves a claim about Social Security numbers, which can be verified through official audits. The prompt's focus on broader implications and credibility might lead to overlooking the specific verifiability of such claims, especially when they pertain to official records.", "Example 4 involves a claim about political party changes, which can often be true but require specific evidence. The prompt's caution against hyperbole might cause it to dismiss the statement without considering the possibility that such changes can indeed occur, especially if backed by credible sources.", "Example 7 involves a statement about the potential impact of a bill on the school year. This is a hypothetical scenario that requires analysis of the bill's language and context, rather than a simple yes/no lie determination. The prompt should account for the need to analyze the implications and details of the statement rather than treating all statements as straightforward factual claims.", "The prompt's approach to determining whether a statement is a lie or not seems to lack a clear threshold for what constitutes a lie. In some cases, like Examples 1 and 7, the statements are more nuanced and require contextual understanding rather than a binary lie/no lie decision. The prompt should clarify the criteria for what qualifies as a lie to better align with the nature of the statements being evaluated.", 'In Examples 5 and 6, the statements pertain to specific industries and court practices, which require specialized knowledge to evaluate. The current prompt does not explicitly account for the expertise or role of the speaker in relation to the subject matter of the statement. The Milwaukee County Sheriff in Example 2 would likely have less relevant experience in baseball regulations or antitrust laws, but the current prompt does not adequately address how to weigh such factors.', 'Examples like 7 and 8 involve statements about historical actions or policy positions that can be fact-checked against historical records or official documents. The current prompt focuses more on the speaker’s credibility and the context rather than the verifiability of the claim itself. A more effective approach would include a step to research and verify the factual accuracy of the statement, regardless of the speaker’s background or the context of the statement.', 'In Examples 1 and 8, the context and the reliability of the source are critical. The House Majority Leader in Example 1 is a significant political figure, and their statement about the stimulus bill failing to create jobs would be considered more credible than a casual claim. Similarly, the senior adviser to President Obama in Example 8 would have a high level of credibility regarding the implementation of Obamacare. The current prompt does not sufficiently weight the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement.', "In Example 2, the statement is also factually accurate, and the context does not suggest any reason to doubt its veracity. However, the prompt might be too skeptical of statements made by politicians, leading to incorrect judgments. The focus on the context and the source's role should be balanced with a more careful examination of the actual content of the statement.", "In Example 4, the statement seems to be a factual claim about political careers, but the lack of a job title, state, and party in the context might have led to a misinterpretation. The prompt should consider the nature of the statement itself more closely, rather than relying solely on external factors like the source's identity or the context.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about President Obama’s financial history, which is a factual claim. The context in an MSNBC discussion might not provide enough evidence to verify this claim definitively. The prompt might not adequately account for the difficulty in verifying such historical claims, leading to a wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 relates to a claim about the status of high-speed rail, which is a factual statement. However, the context of a speech at a Democratic convention might not provide enough evidence to confirm or deny this claim, making it difficult for the prompt to make a reliable judgment.', "Example 5 concerns the accuracy of a statement about students skipping math classes in Oregon. This could be a factual claim or a sensationalized report. The context being a blog post from an Illinois-based blogger might not offer enough evidence to verify the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction based on the prompt's guidelines.", "The prompt may have failed to recognize that some statements are more likely to be opinions or exaggerations, especially those made in informal settings like blog posts or personal comments. In Example 4, the teacher-blogger's statement about students skipping math is more of an opinion or a dramatization rather than a factual claim. The prompt should be more adept at differentiating between factual claims and subjective opinions, particularly in informal or opinion-based media.\n\nIn Example 5, the online comment from a columnist is more likely to be an opinion or a misinformed statement rather than a verifiable fact. Columnists often express opinions or make claims without providing evidence, and the prompt should be more aware of this tendency.\n\nExample 6 involves a historical fact that is widely accepted and taught, making it less likely to be a misstatement. The national security commentator's statement about Crimea’s history should be evaluated against established historical records, and the prompt should reflect this understanding.\n\nIn Example 7, the statement about Wisconsin Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of record. The lack of a job title, state, and party does not change the fact that the statement can be verified through official court records. The prompt should be more focused on verifying claims against reliable sources rather than relying on the speaker’s credentials or affiliations.\n\nExample 8 is about a legal fact regarding antitrust exemptions, which is a well-known and documented aspect of U.S. law. The statement made in a television advertisement should be evaluated against established legal facts, and the prompt should be more adept at recognizing such well-established truths.", "In Examples 7 and 8, the statements are about specific local events or conditions that might not be widely known or verifiable without local knowledge. The statement about the 21st State Senate district being created in secret for a specific person might be based on insider information or rumors, while the claim about students skipping math class to learn about the Bible might be anecdotal or exaggerated. The prompt should allow for a more nuanced evaluation of such statements, considering the source's local expertise and the potential for rumor or exaggeration.", 'In Examples 3 and 8, the statements are self-referential and relate to personal intentions or desires rather than verifiable facts. The prompt should include a clear distinction between statements of intent and factual claims, as these do not require verification and are generally considered opinions.', 'Examples 4 and 5 involve claims that are either too specific or lack sufficient context to verify. The prompt should address how to handle claims that are difficult to verify due to their specificity or the limited available information, guiding the classifier to rely more heavily on the nature of the statement itself.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the statements present information that is either demonstrably false or has been shown to be inaccurate. The prompt needs to include a mechanism for recognizing and flagging such claims, even if they cannot be verified immediately, based on known facts or logical inconsistencies.', 'The job titles, states, and parties provided in the examples do not always align with the content of the statements, leading to confusion. The prompt should clarify that these details should be considered alongside the statement’s content, not as a primary factor in determining its truthfulness.', "The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it places too much emphasis on factual verification through independent sources, which is not always feasible or necessary for a zero-shot classifier. In some cases, the statement might be a known fact or opinion that doesn't require further verification, especially if it aligns with the speaker's known position or context. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Obamacare is a known fact within the political context, and the prediction should reflect this established truth rather than requiring additional verification.", "The prompt might also be overly cautious about political biases without considering the speaker's credibility or the context. In Example 2, the statement from the Milwaukee County Sheriff about balancing budgets or turning back surpluses could be seen as a political claim rather than a factual one, and the prediction should reflect the likelihood of such claims being true or false based on the speaker's role and the context, rather than just the potential for bias.", 'In Example 4, the statement about the word "progressive" being a substitute for "communist" might be a widely known fact or a common political argument. The prompt might need to account for such well-known claims that don\'t necessarily require independent verification, especially when they align with known political narratives.', 'The prompt lacks specific guidance on how to handle statements that are inherently subjective or based on personal beliefs, such as those made by the Executive Director in Example 5 regarding public opinion on same-sex marriage. The prompt should include criteria for distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions, especially when dealing with statements made by individuals without a clear expertise in the subject matter.'] items,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the expertise or role of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect, especially in contexts that suggest a lighter tone or entertainment value. Take into account the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, including the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. Evaluate the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity. Additionally, assess the potential bias of the source and how it might influence the statement. Prioritize the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement, and verify the veracity of specific claims against known facts and reputable sources. Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be too rigid and does not sufficiently account for the dynamic nature of political statements and their context. For example, in Example 1, the President-Elect making a statement about breaking records in a GOP primary can be seen as a hyperbolic claim meant to inspire support rather than a literal factual claim, which the prompt does not adequately consider.', 'In Example 2, the context of a TV ad for a Senate candidate can be biased and sensationalistic, but the prompt focuses heavily on verifying claims against known facts, which may not be appropriate for a political advertisement. The prompt should allow for a more nuanced evaluation of the context and the medium through which the statement is made.', 'Example 3 illustrates a situation where the statement is a direct claim about the governor’s performance, and the context is a serious interview with reputable news sources. Given the nature of political statements, especially those involving policy outcomes like vaccination rates, the prompt should prioritize the credibility of the source and the verifiability of the claim over other factors.', 'Example 4 involves a statement about high-speed rail in a press statement from a Senate President. This type of statement often reflects policy positions and future intentions rather than verifiable past actions, which the prompt does not address adequately. The prompt should recognize that some political statements are forward-looking and may not be subject to the same scrutiny as historical claims.', 'In Example 5, the statement about Hillary Clinton winning polls with Donald Trump as her opponent is a claim about future events, which cannot be definitively verified at the time of the statement. The prompt should account for the speculative nature of such claims, especially in political contexts, and not automatically label them as false without considering the timeframe and the intent behind the statement.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes evaluating the credibility of the source based on their position and context, which can sometimes lead to overlooking the actual content of the statement. In Examples 1, 3, and 7, the statements are factual claims that align with known facts or logical expectations, but the prompt's focus on the source's role and context may have led to dismissing them as lies without proper verification. For instance, advising on self-defense in a campaign ad does not necessarily make the advice false; it just requires careful evaluation of the context and reliability of the source.", "The prompt may also be overly cautious when dealing with statements from political figures, particularly those who are not explicitly identified as lying. In Examples 2 and 5, the statements are factual claims that align with publicly available data, but the prompt's emphasis on the speaker's role and potential bias might have caused it to doubt the accuracy of these claims. The prompt should consider the broader context and evidence supporting a statement before concluding it is a lie.", "The prompt might have failed to recognize that certain statements, even if they seem controversial or politically charged, can still be true. In Examples 4 and 8, the statements reflect the political aspirations and intentions of the speakers, which are often complex and context-dependent. The prompt’s strict criteria for evaluating the veracity of statements might have led it to misjudge these as lies when they were actually truthful expressions of the speakers' positions.", "In Examples 6 and 7, the prompt might have incorrectly assumed that the statements were exaggerated or misleading without sufficient evidence. The statement about Joni Ernst promising to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA and the statement about the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras being directed to private corporations are specific and testable claims. The prompt should prioritize verifying such claims against reliable sources rather than relying solely on the source's reputation or the context of the statement.", 'Lastly, the prompt might have been too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the nuanced nature of some statements. In Example 1, the statement about self-defense advice given by a sheriff during a campaign is a practical piece of advice rather than a lie. Similarly, in Example 3, the statement about Jeff Vanderbeek taking the matter into arbitration is a factual claim that reflects a legal process. The prompt needs to allow for more flexibility in evaluating statements that are not inherently deceptive but require contextual understanding.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need to verify statements against known facts and reputable sources, which can sometimes lead to dismissing statements as lies when they may be opinions or generalizations. In Examples 1, 2, and 7, the statements are more about policy positions and general claims rather than specific, verifiable facts. The prompt’s strict adherence to verifying “known facts” might cause it to incorrectly label these as lies when they are actually valid political statements or opinions.', "Another reason the prompt could be incorrect is its tendency to prioritize the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement. In Examples 3 and 5, the statements are direct and personal, and the speakers are in positions where they can make such claims without needing to cite external sources. The prompt’s focus on verifying against external sources might lead to misjudgment in such cases, where the speaker's authority alone can lend validity to the statement.", 'The prompt may also be failing to recognize the nature of hyperbole or exaggeration, particularly in examples like 4 and 6. Statements in media or political debates often use hyperbolic language for emphasis or rhetorical effect. The prompt’s caution against hyperbole might cause it to dismiss these statements as lies when they are intended to convey a strong message rather than a literal truth. For instance, in Example 4, the statement about job creation in right-to-work states versus unionized states is likely hyperbolic rhetoric designed to highlight a contrast rather than a precise numerical claim.', 'In Examples 1 and 2, the prompt might be overlooking the context of a political debate or media interview. Statements made during debates or interviews are often simplified and generalized for the sake of clarity and impact. The prompt’s requirement to consider the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented might cause it to overanalyze these statements, leading to a misjudgment. These statements are more about conveying a general sentiment or policy stance rather than presenting detailed, verifiable facts.', 'Lastly, the prompt’s emphasis on the potential bias of the source might cause it to incorrectly label statements as lies when they are simply expressing a political viewpoint. In Examples 3 and 6, the speakers are in positions where their statements reflect their political beliefs and actions. The prompt’s focus on bias might lead to a misinterpretation of these statements as inherently false, rather than recognizing them as expressions of political ideology or personal experience.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be overly focused on the reliability of the source and the context, potentially overlooking the actual content of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about automated traffic enforcement cameras is likely a factual claim based on public records and reports, which should be evaluated independently of the job title or context of the policy analyst. Similarly, in Example 2, the acknowledgment from Planned Parenthood to Joe Straus is a specific event that needs to be verified rather than dismissed based on the source's affiliation.", "The prompt could be too rigid in its approach to verifying claims, leading to missed opportunities to accept factual statements. In Example 3, the statement about the national language being English and the implications for ballot printing in New York City is a matter of fact that can be verified against legal documents and official policies, rather than being dismissed based on the context or the speaker's political stance.", 'The prompt might unduly prioritize the credibility of the source over the accuracy of the statement itself. In Example 4, the governor’s claim about vaccination rates is a straightforward factual assertion that can be objectively verified against public health data, rather than being evaluated based on the political affiliation or the context of the interview.', "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to distinguish between different types of claims. In Example 5, the statement about Rep. Justin Amash's voting record is a specific claim that can be cross-checked against legislative records, rather than being judged based on the job title or the context of the article.", "The prompt may not adequately consider the nature of the statement as a claim versus an opinion. In Examples 6 and 7, the statements about tax contributions and vote totals are factual claims that can be verified against official statistics, rather than being dismissed due to the source's political affiliation or the context of the interview or speech."]

Evaluate the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity. Additionally, assess the potential bias of the source and how it might influence the statement. Prioritize the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement, and verify the veracity of specific claims against known facts and reputable sources. Assess the field or domain in which the statement is made, as different areas require varying levels of scrutiny. For example, statements about economic data, such as job creation numbers, require a higher level of statistical and economic analysis. Statements about military or political actions require an understanding of geopolitical and strategic contexts. The prompt should also recognize the type of statement being made and the expertise required to verify it. In Example 4, the claim about political party changes requires specific evidence to support the shift. In Example 3, the statement about throwing away shoes due to mercury from a broken CFL light bulb is an overstatement for emphasis; the classifier should consider the simplification and exaggeration often used in public figures' statements for dramatic effect. The prompt should also handle statements that align with historical events or known facts. For instance, in Example 6, the statement about the absence of successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during a specific period should be evaluated against historical records. Examples like 7 and 8 involve statements about historical actions or policy positions that can be fact-checked against historical records or official documents. The current prompt should include a step to research and verify the factual accuracy of the statement, regardless of the speaker’s background or the context of the statement. Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors.,

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not sufficiently account for the nuances in the context and the reliability of the source. For instance, in Example 1, the policy analyst from the ACLU is likely to be a credible source when discussing public policy issues, especially regarding the distribution of profits from automated traffic enforcement cameras. The prompt should consider the expertise and track record of the source more carefully.\n\nIn Example 2, the context of a radio interview might be less formal and less scrutinized than a formal hearing, potentially leading to more casual or speculative statements. The prompt should recognize that some contexts allow for more subjective or less verifiable claims.\n\nExample 3 involves a highly sensitive and politically charged topic. The prompt should include a mechanism to handle such high-stakes claims more rigorously, possibly requiring additional evidence beyond what is provided.\n\nIn Example 4, the statement about commercial nuclear reactors is a factual claim that requires extensive verification. The prompt should ensure that it accounts for the complexity and potential for misinformation in scientific and technical claims.\n\nFor Example 5, the context of an article by Politico, a reputable news outlet, should be considered more seriously. The prompt should prioritize the credibility of the source when making judgments.', "The prompt's failure to correctly label these examples might stem from its lack of specificity regarding the types of sources and their reliability. For example, in Example 6, the context of a video ad from a political campaign can often contain exaggerated or misleading claims. The prompt should differentiate between various types of media and their inherent biases.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 7, the context of a tweet can be more informal and prone to exaggeration or misrepresentation. The prompt should account for the medium through which the statement is made and how that medium might affect the credibility of the claim.\n\nIn Example 8, the context of a statement made on a nationally syndicated TV show like 'Meet the Press' should carry more weight than a statement made in a less formal setting. The prompt should consider the platform and audience reach when evaluating the credibility of the statement.", 'The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples due to its one-size-fits-all approach to determining the truthfulness of statements. It does not adequately address the varying levels of scrutiny required for different types of claims. For example, in Example 1, the statement about automated traffic enforcement cameras is a factual claim that can be verified through official records or financial reports. The prompt should include a method to distinguish between factual claims and opinions or recommendations.\n\nIn Example 3, the statement about a political plot involving multiple high-profile figures is a complex and sensitive claim that requires a thorough investigation. The prompt should acknowledge the need for more rigorous fact-checking in such cases, possibly involving multiple sources and expert analysis.\n\nFor Example 4, the statement about commercial nuclear reactors is a technical claim that requires detailed scientific verification. The prompt should include a step for assessing the technical accuracy of such statements, considering the expertise needed to verify such claims.', 'The prompt’s failure to correctly label these examples could be due to its lack of consideration for the intended purpose of the statement. In Example 2, the context of a radio interview might be less formal and more prone to speculation or exaggeration. The prompt should take into account the purpose of the communication and the context in which the statement is made.\n\nIn Example 5, the context of an article by Politico, a well-respected news outlet, should be given more weight. The prompt should recognize the credibility of established news sources and the importance of their role in shaping public opinion.\n\nIn Example 7, the context of a tweet can be more informal and less reliable than other forms of communication.

For instance, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen’s U.S. senate candidacy is a factual claim that can be verified through official records, and the context of TV and newspaper interviews provides a basis for checking the truthfulness of the statement. However, the prompt might be too cautious and not give enough weight to the verifiability of the information in such contexts.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Social Security and Medicare is a historical fact that can be cross-referenced with official documents and historical records. The context of an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, which is a news program, adds credibility to the statement. The prompt might be missing the significance of such a context in determining the veracity of the statement.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about city employees not having raises in eight years, which can be checked against official employment records or local government reports. The context of a telephone interview, while less formal, still allows for verification through other means. The prompt might be undervaluing the potential for factual accuracy in such contexts.', 'In Example 4, the statement “Farouk is on fire” is likely a figurative expression used in a musical context to describe enthusiasm or energy, rather than a literal claim. Given the context of a campaign TV ad, the statement is more likely to be an artistic expression rather than a factual claim. The prompt might be overemphasizing the potential for hyperbole in this case, leading to incorrect labeling.', 'Example 5 involves a statement from the Congressional Budget Office, which is typically considered a non-partisan source of economic analysis. The context of a widely circulated email might suggest a need for caution, but the nature of the statement itself and the reputation of the source should lead to a positive label. The prompt might be too skeptical of statements from reputable sources in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.']

Similarly, in Example 2, the comparison between right-to-work and unionized states' job creation is also a factual claim that needs to be substantiated with data, but the prompt's approach might not fully capture the need for detailed economic analysis. These examples suggest that the prompt needs to better recognize the importance of empirical evidence and expert consensus in evaluating factual claims.", 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity regarding the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about nuclear reactor safety is made by a politician without providing any supporting evidence or references. The prompt should include guidance on assessing the credibility of the source and verifying claims against established facts or expert opinions. This would help in correctly identifying misleading or unsupported statements.', "The prompt's approach to distinguishing between factual claims and opinions or recommendations might be too broad, leading to misjudgments. In Example 4, the statement about tax increases is a clear factual claim that can be verified through official records. However, the prompt’s cautionary note about distinguishing opinions and recommendations might cause it to incorrectly label this as an opinion rather than a factual claim. The prompt needs to clarify that certain claims, especially those related to policy or economic data, are to be evaluated based on verifiable facts rather than subjective opinions.", 'In Examples 5 and 6, the statements involve estimates and projections from organizations like the Congressional Budget Office, which are complex and require careful consideration of methodology and assumptions. The prompt should highlight the importance of understanding the basis of such estimates and considering the potential for bias or error. Without this emphasis, the classifier might fail to recognize the nuanced nature of these statements and incorrectly label them as false.', 'Finally, the prompt might not adequately address the context in which statements are made, particularly in lighter or satirical contexts. In Examples 7 and 8, the statements are made in the context of political interviews or media appearances, where the tone and intent of the speaker can influence the interpretation.

  prompt: # Task
Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the expertise or role of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect, especially in contexts that suggest a lighter tone or entertainment value. Take into account the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, including the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. Evaluate the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity. Differentiate clearly between factual claims that can be verified against reliable data or sources and statements of opinion or policy stances. When evaluating the expertise of the speaker, consider their relevant background and knowledge in the subject matter. Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it overly emphasizes the need for factual verification against reliable data or sources, which can sometimes lead to overlooking the possibility that certain statements, particularly those made in a political context, might be opinions or commentary rather than verifiable facts. In Examples 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, the statements are more aligned with political narrative or personal opinions rather than specific, verifiable facts, yet the prompt's strict adherence to factual claims might have led to incorrect judgments.", 'In Examples 1, 3, and 7, the prompt might have failed to recognize the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration, especially when the context suggests a lighter tone or entertainment value. The prompt advises caution with hyperbole but does not provide clear guidance on how to interpret such statements in different contexts, leading to mislabeling.', "The prompt's approach to evaluating the expertise of the speaker might have been too rigid. In Examples 2 and 8, the speakers are not experts in the specific fields they are discussing but are making claims that align more with political rhetoric than expert testimony. The prompt's focus on relevant background and knowledge might have led to an overemphasis on the lack of expertise, resulting in incorrect judgments.", 'The context and source of the statement play a crucial role in determining its accuracy. In Examples 3 and 4, the context and source (a telephone interview and an article) might have been deemed insufficiently credible by the prompt, even though the statements themselves were plausible and supported by common knowledge. This highlights the need for a more nuanced evaluation of context and source reliability.', 'The prompt’s criteria for determining whether a statement is a lie or not might have been too stringent, focusing excessively on verifiability and factual content. Statements like the ones in Examples 5 and 6, which are more about political stance or historical narrative, might be better classified as opinions or policy positions rather than outright lies, yet the prompt’s emphasis on factual claims could have led to misclassification.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and the specific nature of the statements being evaluated. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Rep.

Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about tax contributions by the top 1 percent is also a factual claim that requires verification against reliable economic data, which the prompt might not have fully addressed.', 'In Example 3, the statement advising citizens to use lethal force is highly controversial and potentially illegal, requiring careful evaluation of the source and context. However, the prompt might not have adequately considered the severity and potential legal implications of such a statement, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 4 involves a historical claim about the national debt under Obama, which can be fact-checked using official government reports and economic data. The prompt might not have sufficiently emphasized the need to consult credible economic sources when evaluating such long-term claims, resulting in an incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about tax increases is a specific claim that can be verified against the commissioner’s own records or public financial reports. The prompt might not have highlighted the importance of verifying such claims with concrete evidence from the source making the statement.', 'Example 6 involves a legal claim about traffic laws that can be verified through official transportation regulations. The prompt might not have sufficiently stressed the importance of consulting authoritative legal sources when evaluating such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.']

For instance, in Example 3, the statement about Gov. Terry McAuliffe's desire to be in a Cabinet position is more of an aspiration or intention rather than a factual claim. The prompt's strict criteria for factual verification might have led to an incorrect prediction.", "The prompt could be overly cautious when dealing with statements made in informal or entertainment contexts, which might not require rigorous fact-checking. In Example 2, the statement made by the sheriff in a campaign TV ad is more of a recommendation or advice rather than a factual claim. The prompt's tendency to scrutinize such statements heavily might have resulted in an incorrect prediction.", "Sometimes, the prompt might not fully account for the speaker's expertise or role, especially when the context is less formal or structured. In Example 8, the statement about having more people working in New Jersey is a factual claim that can be verified, but the prompt might have undervalued the potential for such a claim to be true based on the speaker's role in the administration.", "The prompt might not effectively differentiate between statements of opinion and those that are intended to be taken as factual. In Example 5, the statement about Jeff Greene going to Cuba is more of a personal action or travel plan rather than a political stance or policy.

For instance, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen\'s U.S. senate candidacy is likely a factual claim based on the provided job title and context, which should lead to a "No" prediction. The prompt\'s cautionary approach might have led to a misjudgment of the statement\'s veracity without sufficient emphasis on verifying the facts presented.', "In Example 2, the statement about Rep. Justin Amash's voting patterns is a factual claim that can be verified through official records. The context from a reputable news outlet like Politico adds credibility, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker's job title as a commentator may have overshadowed the need to evaluate the statement's factual accuracy directly.", 'Example 3 involves Jeff Greene commenting on going to Cuba, which is a factual statement about a personal action. The lack of any job title or specific context that would suggest it\'s an opinion or a misleading statement should result in a "No" prediction. The prompt might have assumed too much about the speaker\'s credibility without properly assessing the statement\'s content.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Planned Parenthood acknowledging Joe Straus for his efforts is a direct quote from a letter, which is a primary source. The prompt’s caution about verifying claims against reliable data or sources might have led to an incorrect prediction if it did not prioritize the veracity of the direct quote over the potential bias of the nonprofit organization.', 'For Example 5, the statement about high-speed rail creating jobs is a factual claim that requires verification against economic data or reports. The context of a debate does not inherently make the statement less credible; the prediction should be based on the factual basis of the claim rather than the medium in which it is presented.

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the expertise or role of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect, especially in contexts that suggest a lighter tone or entertainment value. Take into account the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, including the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. Evaluate the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity. Differentiate clearly between factual claims that can be verified against reliable data or sources and statements of opinion or policy stances. When evaluating the expertise of the speaker, consider their relevant background and knowledge in the subject matter. 

For political statements, especially those involving policy positions, distinguish between verifiable facts and expressions of opinion or intent. Recognize that political rhetoric often includes hyperbolic language designed to inspire support or convey a message, which may not align with strict factual accuracy. 

For statements of intent or personal actions, such as travel plans or job-related decisions, focus on the verifiability of the claim rather than the speaker's credibility alone. If the statement can be independently confirmed, it should be evaluated accordingly.

For complex issues involving expert opinions or statistical claims, assess whether the statement is supported by credible sources or studies, even if the details are not immediately apparent. Consider the speaker's expertise in the relevant field when evaluating the veracity of their claims.

Differentiate clearly between factual claims that can be verified against reliable data or sources and statements of opinion or policy stances. When evaluating the expertise of the speaker, consider their relevant background and knowledge in the subject matter.

To handle statements that are clearly opinions versus factual claims, provide a clear distinction. Opinions are subjective and reflect personal beliefs, while factual claims require objective evidence to support them. If a statement is an opinion, label it as such, but still evaluate the speaker's credibility and context.

For specific and testable claims, prioritize verifying such claims against reliable sources rather than relying solely on the source's reputation or the context of the statement. If a statement presents information that is either demonstrably false or has been shown to be inaccurate, flag it accordingly, even if immediate verification is not possible. Use available resources and known facts to make informed judgments.

When evaluating the context, consider the setting in which the statement was made. Statements may be accurate within a specific context but may not hold true in a broader context. Always strive to understand the full context before making a determination.

In summary, combine the evaluation of the speaker, the context, and the verifiability of the statement to make a well-rounded judgment. Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors.,

Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the expertise or role of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect, especially in contexts that suggest a lighter tone or entertainment value. Take into account the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, including the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited.

Differentiate clearly between factual claims that can be verified against reliable data or sources and statements of opinion or policy stances. When evaluating the expertise of the speaker, consider their relevant background and knowledge in the subject matter. 

Additionally, consider whether the statement is partially true but misleading due to exaggeration or simplification. If the statement contains elements of truth but is exaggerated or oversimplified in a way that misleads, still evaluate it carefully. For example, if a statement claims that a political party has never changed its stance on an issue when there have been subtle shifts, recognize that the statement is misleading even if it contains a kernel of truth.

For claims about specific events or changes, such as those involving political parties, ensure you have sufficient evidence before dismissing them. Recognize that such changes can occur, especially if supported by credible sources. 

Explicitly consider the source of the statement and the nature of the context. Assess how the context influences the statement's veracity. For instance, a statement made in a light-hearted or satirical context should be evaluated differently than one made in a serious journalistic setting.

Be mindful of hyperbole or exaggeration, but do not overemphasize it at the expense of straightforward claims. Statements that are factually correct or verifiable should not be dismissed solely because they are stated in a way that includes hyperbole. 

Differentiate between opinions and factual claims. Opinions, even if strongly held, are not necessarily lies if they are based on personal beliefs rather than verifiable facts. However, if an opinion is presented as a factual claim, it should be evaluated accordingly.

Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors, ensuring that the evaluation is balanced and nuanced.,

When evaluating the expertise of the speaker, consider their relevant background and knowledge in the subject matter. 

For political statements, especially those involving policy positions, distinguish between verifiable facts and expressions of opinion or intent. Recognize that political rhetoric often includes hyperbolic language designed to inspire support or convey a message, which may not align with strict factual accuracy. 

For statements of intent or personal actions, such as travel plans or job-related decisions, focus on the verifiability of the claim rather than the speaker's credibility alone. If the statement can be independently confirmed, it should be evaluated accordingly.

For complex issues involving expert opinions or statistical claims, assess whether the statement is supported by credible sources or studies, even if the details are not immediately apparent. Consider the speaker's expertise in the relevant field when evaluating the veracity of their claims.

Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors.

Examples 4 and 7 illustrate this issue, where the prompt failed to recognize the truthfulness of the statements without immediate verification, which might not always be feasible in a timely manner.", "The prompt's focus on the broader implications and credibility of information can sometimes lead to overthinking, causing it to miss straightforward factual truths. In Example 6, the prompt incorrectly labeled a statement about personal travel as false, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the simplicity and directness of the claim, which does not require extensive analysis.", "The prompt's detailed evaluation criteria might sometimes result in missed opportunities to quickly identify true statements, particularly when the context and source are clearly reliable.

Statements like "we\'ve broken all-time records" or "polls show Hillary Clinton winning" are often based on the speaker\'s interpretation or predictions, and should be evaluated based on the speaker\'s credibility and the context, rather than their absolute verifiability.', "The prompt's approach may have led to misjudgments in cases where the statement is inherently subjective or opinion-based, such as statements about personal preferences or intentions. For example, statements about a politician's desire to hold a cabinet position or a commentator's vote alignment are more about the speaker's perspective and less about verifiable facts, and should be evaluated based on the speaker's role and the context, rather than their verifiability."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not properly account for the nature of the statement being a factual claim or an opinion. In Examples 1, 3, 5, and 6, the statements are factual claims that require specific verification, which the prompt seems to overlook. The prompt should include a clear directive to verify such claims using available data or expert opinions.', 'In Examples 2 and 7, the statements involve legal advice, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt should consider the reliability of the source more critically in such cases, as legal advice often requires specialized knowledge and context that may not always be evident from the given information.', 'Examples 4 and 8 present statements that are more likely to be political rhetoric or promises rather than verified facts. The prompt should recognize that some political statements are inherently uncertain and may be intended to influence public opinion rather than present verifiable facts. This distinction is crucial for accurate classification.', "The prompt does not sufficiently weigh the context and the role of the speaker in evaluating the credibility of the statement. For instance, in Example 3, the statement is made by the Florida Senate President, who is in a position to make such claims about legislative achievements. The prompt should give more weight to the speaker's role and authority in making such claims.", 'In Example 1, the statement about the national debt reduction under Obama is a complex factual claim that requires detailed historical and economic data to verify. The prompt should include a step to research and cross-reference such claims with reputable sources before labeling them as true or false.']

  feedbacks: ['The prompt fails to consider the credibility of the source or the context in which the statement is made. For instance, in Example 1, the context does not relate to the statement about President Obama firing missiles, yet the prediction is incorrect. The prompt should take into account whether the speaker or writer has expertise or access to accurate information relevant to the claim.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are false and those that are simply not verifiable with the given information. In Example 7, the statement about the ZIP code being the second-most gentrified might be true but cannot be verified without additional data, so it should not be labeled as a lie.', "The prompt does not account for political biases that might influence the statement's accuracy. In Example 5, the statement aligns with a Republican perspective but is still labeled as a lie. The context and job title should help determine if the statement is plausible based on the speaker’s likely knowledge or interest.", 'The prompt lacks consideration for the reliability of the source, especially in cases where the statement is from a partisan source. For example, in Example 4, the mayor’s statement about investment might be true but is incorrectly labeled as a lie because the source is a Democrat, while the label “Yes” implies it is true.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In Example 4, the statement about starting 20 points behind and ending 20 points ahead is more likely to be an opinion or anecdotal evidence rather than a factual claim, which the prompt incorrectly labels as false.', 'The prompt lacks specificity regarding the reliability of the information provided. In Example 5, the statement about inmate conditions is made in a guest column, which may lack rigorous fact-checking. The prompt should consider the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity.', "The prompt does not take into account the expertise or role of the speaker when evaluating the statement's truthfulness. In Example 7, a state delegate making a statement about legislation would be expected to have some knowledge of the issue, but the prompt does not weigh this factor in its assessment.", 'The prompt does not address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements, especially in opinion pieces or media commentary. In Example 8, the statement comparing the wealth of black America to a country is likely exaggerated for rhetorical effect rather than intended to convey a precise statistical fact. The prompt should recognize such rhetorical devices when evaluating the truthfulness of statements.', "The examples suggest that the model might be influenced by the speaker's political affiliation or role, leading it to incorrectly judge statements as true or false. For instance, statements from Republican candidates are sometimes incorrectly labeled as lies, possibly due to a bias against their party.", 'The context provided in the examples might not always contain enough information to determine the truthfulness of the statement. The model might be making assumptions based on the type of media or the speaker’s role, rather than evaluating the statement itself for factual correctness.', 'The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to consider the source of the statement or the nature of the context when determining if a statement is a lie. This lack of direction may cause the model to rely more on the content of the statement itself, potentially missing nuances in the context that could affect its veracity.', 'The model might be too literal in interpreting the phrase "determine if the statement is a lie," leading it to focus solely on the content of the statement without considering the broader implications or the reliability of the source. This could result in incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with statements that might be controversial but not necessarily false.', 'The prompt may be too simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the statements. It assumes that any statement contradicting commonly held beliefs or statistical facts is a lie, without considering the context, evidence, and reliability of the source. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about marijuana potency might be based on credible research, but the prompt does not allow for such nuance.', 'The prompt does not consider the possibility of misleading or hyperbolic language in the statements. In Example 3, the claim about birthright citizenship might be a simplification or exaggeration for effect, which the prompt interprets as a lie without considering the intent behind the statement.', "The prompt does not consider the context in which the statement was made. In Example 7, the statement about New Jersey's tenure law reform might be accurate within the context of the speech, but the prompt does not allow for this contextual understanding. The context is crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement.", "In Examples 2 and 6, the statements pertain to specific policy areas (insurance options and campaign finance) that the speakers (U.S. Representative and U.S. Representative) might be knowledgeable about, potentially making their opinions more credible. However, the prompt treats all statements equally without considering the speaker's domain expertise.", 'Examples 3 and 8 involve statistical claims about mortality rates and historical events, respectively. These types of claims often require rigorous data validation, which might not be immediately apparent from the given context. The prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to seek out additional verification for such claims.', 'In Examples 4 and 5, the statements concern government actions and public opinion trends. Given the high stakes and often complex nature of these topics, the reliability of the statement can be influenced by the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. The prompt does not adequately address the need to consider the broader implications and sources of information in these cases.', 'Examples 7 and 8 highlight statements that are either factually incorrect or exaggerated for comedic effect. The prompt should include a consideration for the medium (e.g., a satirical news show) and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration, especially when the context suggests a lighter tone or entertainment value.', 'In Example 2, the price change of Slim Jims is a specific factual claim that can be verified through market data or company records. The prompt might have overlooked the possibility of such claims needing empirical evidence rather than just considering the reliability of the source.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the financial impact of cancer, which could be a complex issue requiring detailed analysis and data. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as false without considering the possibility that the statement, though exaggerated, could be based on credible sources or studies, especially if the speaker has relevant expertise.', "In Example 4, the statement about the New York Times article might require a thorough review of the article itself, including checking if there were any earlier mentions of wrongdoing. The prompt might have failed to consider the need for a deeper analysis of the source material beyond just the speaker's job title.", "Example 5 about the Miami Dolphins paying property taxes is a factual claim that could be verified through public records. The prompt might have overlooked the importance of verifying such claims independently rather than relying solely on the speaker's role as a politician.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of historical accuracy. The statement about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more may be a simplified or exaggerated claim. The prompt should take into account the broader implications and the potential for hyperbole in historical claims, especially when presented in a satirical context like "The Daily Show."', "Example 4 involves a statement about budget shortfalls made by someone with a specific job title and political affiliation. The prompt may not fully appreciate the complexity of budget processes and the role of local officials in managing state finances. It should consider the credibility of the speaker's position and their potential influence on budget decisions.", "Example 5 deals with a statement about Donald Trump’s disapproval ratings, which can be highly politicized and subject to rapid changes. The prompt may not adequately account for the dynamic nature of public opinion and the influence of political campaigns on perceived approval ratings. It should consider the context of the statement and the speaker's motivation in making such a claim.", 'In Example 2, the statement about cancer and kidney failure killing more people than malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS in Kenya is plausible due to the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in many African countries. However, the prompt’s focus on factual correctness without acknowledging the possibility of valid statistical claims led to the incorrect prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the Obama administration and the Amber Alert program. While it is factually incorrect that the Amber Alert program was shut down during a government shutdown, the prompt’s emphasis on evaluating the speaker’s role and political affiliation might have overshadowed the need to check the factual accuracy, leading to the wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 is about a personal experience involving snow during a football game. The statement is likely exaggerated or a hyperbole, common in sports commentary. The prompt’s strict adherence to evaluating factual correctness without considering rhetorical devices and personal accounts led to the incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the narrowing of insurance options under the Affordable Care Act is complex and context-dependent. While the prompt acknowledges the influence of the speaker’s role, it does not provide a method to verify such claims accurately, leading to the incorrect prediction. The statement might be true in specific regions or demographics, but the prompt did not allow for this nuance.', 'The prompt may have failed to recognize the specific context and nature of the statements due to a lack of detailed instruction on how to evaluate statements that are known to be hyperbole or exaggerations for rhetorical effect. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about playing in a game with 23 inches of snow is likely meant as a figure of speech rather than a literal fact, yet the prompt does not explicitly guide the classifier to distinguish between literal and figurative language.', "In Example 3, the statement about throwing away shoes if mercury from a broken CFL light bulb gets on them is an overstatement for emphasis, and the prompt might not have adequately addressed the need to consider the simplification and exaggeration often used in public figures' statements for dramatic effect. The classifier may have incorrectly assumed the statement was a factual recommendation.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about tax contributions, which is a complex economic issue that can be misleading without proper context. The prompt should include guidance on recognizing statistical claims and their potential misinterpretation, especially when made by politicians with a particular agenda.', 'In Example 7, the statement about The New York Times not pointing out wrongdoing until a later paragraph is likely a critique of journalistic practices, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt needs to clarify that some statements are critiques or opinions and should not be evaluated solely based on factual accuracy.', 'The prompt does not adequately address how to handle statements that are partially true but misleading due to exaggeration or simplification. In Examples 3, 5, and 7, the statements are simplified or exaggerated, but the prompt does not provide clear guidance on how to evaluate such claims, leading to incorrect "No" predictions.', 'The prompt lacks specificity in how to handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or personal experiences, which can be difficult to verify. In Example 2, the statement about out-of-state gasoline purchases is likely an opinion or a generalization, and the prompt does not provide clear instructions on how to evaluate such statements, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'The prompt\'s instruction to "Do not assume the statement is false just because it contradicts common knowledge or your personal beliefs" might be misinterpreted as a directive to always label statements as "No" if they seem implausible. This can lead to incorrect "No" predictions in cases like Example 8, where the statement about the Amber Alert program shutdown is plausible and aligns with known events, but the prompt\'s caution might cause evaluators to doubt its accuracy.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently consider the context and the credibility of the sources when evaluating the statements. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about illegal immigration is likely a misrepresentation of facts, yet the prompt does not adequately address how political rhetoric can distort reality. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about the Bush administration writing checks to General Motors without conditions is a known falsehood, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker’s role and context might not fully capture the historical and factual inaccuracies involved.', 'Example 4 involves a price change for a product, which can fluctuate due to market dynamics and supply chain issues. The prompt’s evaluation might not adequately account for such practical and temporal changes, leading to a misclassification of the statement as a lie when it is simply an outdated claim.', 'In Example 5, the tax benefits for charitable donations are complex and vary widely depending on the amount donated and the donor’s specific circumstances. The prompt’s approach might not appropriately handle nuanced financial claims, especially when the source is a public figure like a former White House Press Secretary, whose statements could be intended to highlight perceived injustices rather than being strictly factually accurate.', 'Example 6 likely refers to a misconception about mercury exposure from CFL bulbs, which is a common myth. The prompt’s focus on the source and context might not effectively counteract such misinformation, leading to an incorrect classification of the statement as true when it is actually a widespread misconception.', 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in how to evaluate the truthfulness of statements. It does not provide clear guidelines on how to assess the credibility of the information provided in the context, job title, state, and party. This ambiguity allows the classifier to make incorrect judgments based on incomplete or irrelevant information.', 'The examples suggest that the classifier might be overly literal or not considering the broader implications or historical context. For instance, in Example 2, the statement is about past actions and legal decisions, which might not reflect current policy positions. The classifier should consider the temporal and contextual aspects of the statement.', 'The prompt does not specify how to handle statements that are opinions versus factual claims. In many cases, the classifier seems to treat opinions as lies if they do not align with the current or expected position of the politician. This misalignment can lead to incorrect predictions, as it conflates opinion with fact.', 'The examples indicate that the classifier might be failing to recognize the nuances in language use, such as hyperbole or sarcasm. Statements that exaggerate or use rhetorical devices might be incorrectly classified as false. The prompt needs to include guidance on how to interpret such language accurately.', 'The prompt lacks an understanding of the specific fields or domains in which the statements are made. Statements about economic data, such as job creation numbers in Example 2, require a different level of scrutiny than statements about military or political actions. The prompt needs to recognize the type of statement being made and the expertise required to verify it.', 'The prompt does not address the reliability of the source or the potential for misinformation. In Example 7, the statement about the retirement fund not being funded might be a deliberate misrepresentation or a misunderstanding. Without considering the source’s reliability and the possibility of intentional deception, the prompt cannot accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.', "The prompt does not account for the complexity and specificity required to evaluate statements accurately. It treats all statements as equally verifiable, which can lead to incorrect judgments, especially when dealing with niche or less-known facts. For example, the mercury disposal statement requires specific knowledge about environmental health, while the Koch brothers' donations to political candidates involve detailed financial records that may not be readily available or accurate without proper verification.", "The prompt lacks context sensitivity, particularly in recognizing the source of information and the reliability of the speaker. In Example 3, the statement about Donald Trump's disapproval ratings being second-highest would require checking actual polling data, which might not align with what a senator claims. Similarly, Example 4 about the Koch brothers' donations would need a detailed financial audit rather than a simple yes/no judgment.", 'The prompt does not consider the dynamic nature of information, such as changing conditions or recent events. Example 6 about cancer and kidney failure deaths in Kenya might be correct at the time of the speech but could change due to new medical research or policy changes. The classifier should be aware that some statements may be true at the moment but become outdated quickly.', 'The prompt does not handle statistical claims effectively. Statements involving numbers, like the one in Example 2 about the American slave trade causing 5 million deaths or more, require historical research and data analysis. Without proper validation, the classifier might incorrectly judge a statement as false based on its own limited understanding of historical facts.', "The prompt does not adequately consider the expertise of the speaker. For instance, in Example 1, a lawyer stating that living in different state districts does not matter when running for Congress should be considered a lie due to the speaker's professional knowledge, even though the context does not explicitly contradict the statement. The current prompt does not account for such domain-specific information.", 'The prompt does not differentiate between statements that are opinion-based versus those that can be verified. In Examples 3 and 4, the statements about the Affordable Care Act and mercury exposure are matters of fact that can be verified through data and expert opinion, rather than personal beliefs. The current prompt treats all statements equally without considering their verifiability.', 'The prompt also lacks sensitivity to the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about child sex trafficking in Milwaukee might be accurate according to reliable data sources not mentioned in the context. The governor’s statement alone does not necessarily make it a lie without additional evidence suggesting otherwise. The prompt should consider the credibility of the source more carefully.', 'The prompt might not effectively handle statements that align with historical events or known facts. In Example 6, the statement about the absence of successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks during a specific period is likely accurate based on historical records, which were not mentioned in the speech context. The prompt should take into account the broader historical context to better evaluate such claims.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly relies on the reliability of the source and the alignment with commonly accepted facts without considering the specific context and the nature of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about playing in a snowy game is plausible within the context of ESPN sports commentary, despite the improbability of such a scenario. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about not voting for tax increases aligns with the job title and context of a U.S. Senate debate, making it reasonable to consider it truthful.', 'In Example 5, the statement about water usage growth is specific and quantitative. The prompt might not fully evaluate the plausibility and supporting evidence for such claims, focusing instead on the source’s credibility and the general context. This oversight could lead to an incorrect judgment, as the claim about water usage growth might be verifiable through official records.', 'Example 6 discusses gasoline purchases, which can vary widely based on local economies and consumer behavior. The statement is specific and could be true if supported by reliable data. The prompt might not effectively assess the statistical accuracy and relevance of such claims, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt's reliance on political biases can lead to biased judgments. Statements from politicians of opposing parties might be incorrectly labeled as false due to preconceived notions rather than factual analysis. In Example 4, the statement about the Koch brothers' donations to Scott Walker is a factual claim that requires verification, not a judgment based on political affiliation.", "In Example 2, the statement about the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of federal taxes is a factual claim that can be verified against tax data. The prompt might not adequately consider the verifiability of the information provided by the source, instead focusing too much on the source's political affiliation.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of context-specific accuracy. "Romneycare" refers to healthcare reform in Massachusetts, which is different from the national context. The prompt might not sufficiently account for regional differences and the specificity of the context when evaluating the statement\'s accuracy.', 'Example 4 involves the statement about firing employees. While it might be true in certain contexts, the prompt might not consider the specific legal framework or company policies that could vary, leading to a blanket "no" prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about job creation under Republican and Democratic administrations is a complex economic claim that requires detailed data analysis. The prompt might not effectively handle the nuance of such claims, especially when they involve long-term trends and multiple factors influencing job creation.', "The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately distinguish between factual claims and opinions, especially when the speaker has a specific role or job title. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about people having active Social Security numbers at 112 years of age is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on available data rather than the speaker's role as a U.S. Senator. The prompt should emphasize the importance of verifying such claims through reliable sources.", 'In Example 2, the statement about not raising taxes is more of an opinion or policy stance rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt needs to better differentiate between factual claims and statements of opinion, especially in political contexts. The prediction of "No" might be inappropriate if the statement is simply expressing a personal or organizational viewpoint without providing verifiable evidence.', 'Example 3 involves a statement regarding the workload of Supreme Court justices, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors. The prompt should recognize that some statements might be more interpretive and less susceptible to straightforward verification. In this case, the prediction of "No" might be incorrect because the statement reflects an interpretation of court activity rather than a definitive fact.', 'Example 4 discusses public opinion polls, which are inherently subjective and can vary over time. The prompt should consider that some statements might reflect broader trends or attitudes rather than verifiable facts. The prediction of "No" might be incorrect if the statement is accurately reflecting ongoing changes in public opinion.', 'The prompt may have failed to correctly label these examples because it does not adequately account for the nature of historical statements or the context of opinion pieces. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Ben Franklin is a well-known historical anecdote, and the job title and context do not change its status as a widely accepted fact. Similarly, in Example 3, the statement about running for the U.S. Senate is a personal decision that does not require factual verification, and thus should be labeled as not a lie. The prompt needs to recognize that some statements are based on personal beliefs or historical facts rather than verifiable claims.', 'Examples 4 and 5 involve statements that are either comparative or historical in nature. In Example 4, the statement about Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of interpretation and trend analysis, which may be true or false based on available data. In Example 5, the statement about Republican politicians becoming Democrats is a factual claim that can be verified through records, but the prompt does not seem to consider the possibility of such changes. The prompt should include a more nuanced approach to evaluating comparative and historical claims.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the prompt might have mislabeled these statements due to a lack of clear criteria for distinguishing between factual claims and assertions based on subjective beliefs or political agendas. The statement about America being number one in oil and gas is a factual claim that can be verified, while the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is a subjective opinion. The prompt needs to provide clearer guidelines on how to differentiate between these types of claims.', 'The prompt might also be too cautious about hyperbole or exaggeration, potentially leading to over-evaluation of such elements at the expense of more straightforward claims. In Example 2, the statement about the Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a factual claim that does not require extensive contextual analysis; it can be evaluated based on available data. Overanalyzing the context and source reliability in such cases can result in misjudgments.', 'Another reason could be the lack of clear guidance on how to handle statements that are clearly opinions versus factual claims. In Example 3, the statement about Latino support for the DREAM Act is an opinion, and the fact that Marco Rubio opposes it is a factual claim. The prompt might not have provided enough clarity on distinguishing between these types of statements, leading to confusion and incorrect labeling.', 'The prompt might also fail to consider the specific nature of the context, such as the medium or platform where the statement is made. In Example 5, the statement about baseball and insurance being exempt from antitrust laws is a factual claim that can be verified through legal sources, regardless of the context or medium. The prompt’s emphasis on the type of publication or platform might have led to overlooking the verifiability of the statement.', "In Example 2, the prompt's focus on the credibility of polling data might have led to an incorrect classification. While the poll has a history of inaccuracy, the statement itself is not necessarily false; it is more about the reliability of the poll, which the prompt does not handle well. The model might have misinterpreted this as a factual claim rather than recognizing it as a statement about past performance.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about personal intentions, which the prompt seems to classify as a lie, possibly due to its phrasing. However, the statement is a hypothetical question ("On whether he wants to be vice president"), and it\'s not appropriate to label such a question as a lie. The prompt\'s strict criteria for evaluating truthfulness might have led to an incorrect label.', "In Example 4, the statement about judges' benefits is a factual claim that requires specific verification. The prompt's emphasis on broader implications and context might have caused the model to overlook the need for fact-checking. Given the limited information provided, the statement could be true or false, and a more direct approach to verifying the claim would be necessary.", "Example 5 refers to a historical fact about President Obama, which the prompt might have incorrectly classified as a lie due to the lack of direct evidence in the context. However, given that President Obama did not receive paychecks from profitmaking businesses, the statement is factually correct. The prompt's tendency to err on the side of caution might have led to a misclassification.", 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need to consider the reliability of the source and the broader implications, which can lead to misjudging statements that are factually correct but are made by sources that are generally considered less credible. For example, in Example 1, the statement about Crimea is historically accurate, but the source, a national security commentator for CNN, might be seen as less reliable due to their job title and political affiliation, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt's consideration of the broader implications and credibility of the information might lead it to dismiss statements that are factually correct but are made in contexts that are generally viewed as unreliable. In Example 4, the statement about the non-existence of a specific funding pot is factually correct, but the context of a redistricting meeting might make the source seem less credible, resulting in a misclassification.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is likely an opinion or exaggeration rather than a factual claim. However, the prompt might not adequately distinguish between strong opinions and outright falsehoods, leading to an incorrect "No" prediction.', 'Example 3 involves a specific and potentially absurd claim about Social Security numbers. The prompt might not effectively handle such extreme or implausible statements, tending to label them as factual unless explicitly stated otherwise, thus incorrectly predicting "No."', 'In Example 4, the statement about America being No. 1 in oil and gas is a broad claim that might be misleading or exaggerated. The prompt’s caution against hyperbole could be misapplied, leading to an incorrect "No" if it fails to recognize the claim as potentially false due to overgeneralization or lack of context.', 'For Example 5, the statement about a $30 million pot for redistricting is likely false or misleading. The prompt might miss the specific nature of the claim as a false statement if it focuses more on the general credibility of the speaker rather than the veracity of the specific claim.', "In Example 2, the source is from an organization opposing same-sex marriage, which might bias the statement. The prompt should consider the source's potential bias and align the judgment more closely with the context, recognizing that the source might not always present balanced views.", "Example 3 involves a claim about Social Security numbers, which can be verified through official audits. The prompt's focus on broader implications and credibility might lead to overlooking the specific verifiability of such claims, especially when they pertain to official records.", "Example 4 involves a claim about political party changes, which can often be true but require specific evidence. The prompt's caution against hyperbole might cause it to dismiss the statement without considering the possibility that such changes can indeed occur, especially if backed by credible sources.", "Example 7 involves a statement about the potential impact of a bill on the school year. This is a hypothetical scenario that requires analysis of the bill's language and context, rather than a simple yes/no lie determination. The prompt should account for the need to analyze the implications and details of the statement rather than treating all statements as straightforward factual claims.", "The prompt's approach to determining whether a statement is a lie or not seems to lack a clear threshold for what constitutes a lie. In some cases, like Examples 1 and 7, the statements are more nuanced and require contextual understanding rather than a binary lie/no lie decision. The prompt should clarify the criteria for what qualifies as a lie to better align with the nature of the statements being evaluated.", 'In Examples 5 and 6, the statements pertain to specific industries and court practices, which require specialized knowledge to evaluate. The current prompt does not explicitly account for the expertise or role of the speaker in relation to the subject matter of the statement. The Milwaukee County Sheriff in Example 2 would likely have less relevant experience in baseball regulations or antitrust laws, but the current prompt does not adequately address how to weigh such factors.', 'Examples like 7 and 8 involve statements about historical actions or policy positions that can be fact-checked against historical records or official documents. The current prompt focuses more on the speaker’s credibility and the context rather than the verifiability of the claim itself. A more effective approach would include a step to research and verify the factual accuracy of the statement, regardless of the speaker’s background or the context of the statement.', 'In Examples 1 and 8, the context and the reliability of the source are critical. The House Majority Leader in Example 1 is a significant political figure, and their statement about the stimulus bill failing to create jobs would be considered more credible than a casual claim. Similarly, the senior adviser to President Obama in Example 8 would have a high level of credibility regarding the implementation of Obamacare. The current prompt does not sufficiently weight the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement.', "In Example 2, the statement is also factually accurate, and the context does not suggest any reason to doubt its veracity. However, the prompt might be too skeptical of statements made by politicians, leading to incorrect judgments. The focus on the context and the source's role should be balanced with a more careful examination of the actual content of the statement.", "In Example 4, the statement seems to be a factual claim about political careers, but the lack of a job title, state, and party in the context might have led to a misinterpretation. The prompt should consider the nature of the statement itself more closely, rather than relying solely on external factors like the source's identity or the context.", 'Example 3 involves a statement about President Obama’s financial history, which is a factual claim. The context in an MSNBC discussion might not provide enough evidence to verify this claim definitively. The prompt might not adequately account for the difficulty in verifying such historical claims, leading to a wrong prediction.', 'Example 4 relates to a claim about the status of high-speed rail, which is a factual statement. However, the context of a speech at a Democratic convention might not provide enough evidence to confirm or deny this claim, making it difficult for the prompt to make a reliable judgment.', "Example 5 concerns the accuracy of a statement about students skipping math classes in Oregon. This could be a factual claim or a sensationalized report. The context being a blog post from an Illinois-based blogger might not offer enough evidence to verify the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction based on the prompt's guidelines.", "The prompt may have failed to recognize that some statements are more likely to be opinions or exaggerations, especially those made in informal settings like blog posts or personal comments. In Example 4, the teacher-blogger's statement about students skipping math is more of an opinion or a dramatization rather than a factual claim. The prompt should be more adept at differentiating between factual claims and subjective opinions, particularly in informal or opinion-based media.\n\nIn Example 5, the online comment from a columnist is more likely to be an opinion or a misinformed statement rather than a verifiable fact. Columnists often express opinions or make claims without providing evidence, and the prompt should be more aware of this tendency.\n\nExample 6 involves a historical fact that is widely accepted and taught, making it less likely to be a misstatement. The national security commentator's statement about Crimea’s history should be evaluated against established historical records, and the prompt should reflect this understanding.\n\nIn Example 7, the statement about Wisconsin Supreme Court justices deciding fewer opinions is a matter of record. The lack of a job title, state, and party does not change the fact that the statement can be verified through official court records. The prompt should be more focused on verifying claims against reliable sources rather than relying on the speaker’s credentials or affiliations.\n\nExample 8 is about a legal fact regarding antitrust exemptions, which is a well-known and documented aspect of U.S. law. The statement made in a television advertisement should be evaluated against established legal facts, and the prompt should be more adept at recognizing such well-established truths.", "In Examples 7 and 8, the statements are about specific local events or conditions that might not be widely known or verifiable without local knowledge. The statement about the 21st State Senate district being created in secret for a specific person might be based on insider information or rumors, while the claim about students skipping math class to learn about the Bible might be anecdotal or exaggerated. The prompt should allow for a more nuanced evaluation of such statements, considering the source's local expertise and the potential for rumor or exaggeration.", 'In Examples 3 and 8, the statements are self-referential and relate to personal intentions or desires rather than verifiable facts. The prompt should include a clear distinction between statements of intent and factual claims, as these do not require verification and are generally considered opinions.', 'Examples 4 and 5 involve claims that are either too specific or lack sufficient context to verify. The prompt should address how to handle claims that are difficult to verify due to their specificity or the limited available information, guiding the classifier to rely more heavily on the nature of the statement itself.', 'In Examples 6 and 7, the statements present information that is either demonstrably false or has been shown to be inaccurate. The prompt needs to include a mechanism for recognizing and flagging such claims, even if they cannot be verified immediately, based on known facts or logical inconsistencies.', 'The job titles, states, and parties provided in the examples do not always align with the content of the statements, leading to confusion. The prompt should clarify that these details should be considered alongside the statement’s content, not as a primary factor in determining its truthfulness.', "The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it places too much emphasis on factual verification through independent sources, which is not always feasible or necessary for a zero-shot classifier. In some cases, the statement might be a known fact or opinion that doesn't require further verification, especially if it aligns with the speaker's known position or context. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Obamacare is a known fact within the political context, and the prediction should reflect this established truth rather than requiring additional verification.", "The prompt might also be overly cautious about political biases without considering the speaker's credibility or the context. In Example 2, the statement from the Milwaukee County Sheriff about balancing budgets or turning back surpluses could be seen as a political claim rather than a factual one, and the prediction should reflect the likelihood of such claims being true or false based on the speaker's role and the context, rather than just the potential for bias.", 'In Example 4, the statement about the word "progressive" being a substitute for "communist" might be a widely known fact or a common political argument. The prompt might need to account for such well-known claims that don\'t necessarily require independent verification, especially when they align with known political narratives.', 'The prompt lacks specific guidance on how to handle statements that are inherently subjective or based on personal beliefs, such as those made by the Executive Director in Example 5 regarding public opinion on same-sex marriage. The prompt should include criteria for distinguishing between objective facts and subjective opinions, especially when dealing with statements made by individuals without a clear expertise in the subject matter.', 'The prompt may be too rigid and does not sufficiently account for the dynamic nature of political statements and their context. For example, in Example 1, the President-Elect making a statement about breaking records in a GOP primary can be seen as a hyperbolic claim meant to inspire support rather than a literal factual claim, which the prompt does not adequately consider.', 'In Example 2, the context of a TV ad for a Senate candidate can be biased and sensationalistic, but the prompt focuses heavily on verifying claims against known facts, which may not be appropriate for a political advertisement. The prompt should allow for a more nuanced evaluation of the context and the medium through which the statement is made.', 'Example 3 illustrates a situation where the statement is a direct claim about the governor’s performance, and the context is a serious interview with reputable news sources. Given the nature of political statements, especially those involving policy outcomes like vaccination rates, the prompt should prioritize the credibility of the source and the verifiability of the claim over other factors.', 'In Example 5, the statement about Hillary Clinton winning polls with Donald Trump as her opponent is a claim about future events, which cannot be definitively verified at the time of the statement. The prompt should account for the speculative nature of such claims, especially in political contexts, and not automatically label them as false without considering the timeframe and the intent behind the statement.', "In Examples 6 and 7, the prompt might have incorrectly assumed that the statements were exaggerated or misleading without sufficient evidence. The statement about Joni Ernst promising to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA and the statement about the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras being directed to private corporations are specific and testable claims. The prompt should prioritize verifying such claims against reliable sources rather than relying solely on the source's reputation or the context of the statement.", 'Lastly, the prompt might have been too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the nuanced nature of some statements. In Example 1, the statement about self-defense advice given by a sheriff during a campaign is a practical piece of advice rather than a lie. Similarly, in Example 3, the statement about Jeff Vanderbeek taking the matter into arbitration is a factual claim that reflects a legal process. The prompt needs to allow for more flexibility in evaluating statements that are not inherently deceptive but require contextual understanding.', 'In Examples 1 and 2, the prompt might be overlooking the context of a political debate or media interview. Statements made during debates or interviews are often simplified and generalized for the sake of clarity and impact. The prompt’s requirement to consider the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented might cause it to overanalyze these statements, leading to a misjudgment. These statements are more about conveying a general sentiment or policy stance rather than presenting detailed, verifiable facts.', "The prompt may be overly focused on the reliability of the source and the context, potentially overlooking the actual content of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about automated traffic enforcement cameras is likely a factual claim based on public records and reports, which should be evaluated independently of the job title or context of the policy analyst. Similarly, in Example 2, the acknowledgment from Planned Parenthood to Joe Straus is a specific event that needs to be verified rather than dismissed based on the source's affiliation.", "The prompt could be too rigid in its approach to verifying claims, leading to missed opportunities to accept factual statements. In Example 3, the statement about the national language being English and the implications for ballot printing in New York City is a matter of fact that can be verified against legal documents and official policies, rather than being dismissed based on the context or the speaker's political stance.", "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to distinguish between different types of claims. In Example 5, the statement about Rep. Justin Amash's voting record is a specific claim that can be cross-checked against legislative records, rather than being judged based on the job title or the context of the article.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Social Security and Medicare is a historical fact that can be cross-referenced with official documents and historical records. The context of an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, which is a news program, adds credibility to the statement. The prompt might be missing the significance of such a context in determining the veracity of the statement.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about city employees not having raises in eight years, which can be checked against official employment records or local government reports. The context of a telephone interview, while less formal, still allows for verification through other means. The prompt might be undervaluing the potential for factual accuracy in such contexts.', 'In Example 4, the statement “Farouk is on fire” is likely a figurative expression used in a musical context to describe enthusiasm or energy, rather than a literal claim. Given the context of a campaign TV ad, the statement is more likely to be an artistic expression rather than a factual claim. The prompt might be overemphasizing the potential for hyperbole in this case, leading to incorrect labeling.', 'Example 5 involves a statement from the Congressional Budget Office, which is typically considered a non-partisan source of economic analysis. The context of a widely circulated email might suggest a need for caution, but the nature of the statement itself and the reputation of the source should lead to a positive label. The prompt might be too skeptical of statements from reputable sources in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity regarding the reliability and source of the information. In Example 3, the statement about nuclear reactor safety is made by a politician without providing any supporting evidence or references. The prompt should include guidance on assessing the credibility of the source and verifying claims against established facts or expert opinions. This would help in correctly identifying misleading or unsupported statements.', 'In Examples 5 and 6, the statements involve estimates and projections from organizations like the Congressional Budget Office, which are complex and require careful consideration of methodology and assumptions. The prompt should highlight the importance of understanding the basis of such estimates and considering the potential for bias or error. Without this emphasis, the classifier might fail to recognize the nuanced nature of these statements and incorrectly label them as false.', 'In Example 2, the statement "I\'m pro-life. He\'s not" is a direct opinion expressed by a politician, and the prompt might not adequately recognize this as an opinion rather than a factual claim, thus leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 3 involves a statement comparing job creation in right-to-work states versus heavily unionized states. While the statement is a factual claim, the context and nature of the debate might allow for some exaggeration or selective data presentation, which the prompt does not sufficiently account for.', 'In Example 4, the statement about having more people working in New Jersey is a factual claim, but the prompt might not recognize the possibility of recent positive economic trends or statistical anomalies without additional context, leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 5 discusses the profit from automated traffic enforcement cameras. While the statement is a factual claim, the context of a hearing at the General Assembly might include discussions on policy and financial practices that are subject to interpretation and rhetoric, which the prompt might not fully account for.', "The prompt's approach to evaluating the expertise of the speaker might have been too rigid. In Examples 2 and 8, the speakers are not experts in the specific fields they are discussing but are making claims that align more with political rhetoric than expert testimony. The prompt's focus on relevant background and knowledge might have led to an overemphasis on the lack of expertise, resulting in incorrect judgments.", 'In Example 3, the statement advising citizens to use lethal force is highly controversial and potentially illegal, requiring careful evaluation of the source and context. However, the prompt might not have adequately considered the severity and potential legal implications of such a statement, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 4 involves a historical claim about the national debt under Obama, which can be fact-checked using official government reports and economic data. The prompt might not have sufficiently emphasized the need to consult credible economic sources when evaluating such long-term claims, resulting in an incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 5, the statement about tax increases is a specific claim that can be verified against the commissioner’s own records or public financial reports. The prompt might not have highlighted the importance of verifying such claims with concrete evidence from the source making the statement.', 'Example 6 involves a legal claim about traffic laws that can be verified through official transportation regulations. The prompt might not have sufficiently stressed the importance of consulting authoritative legal sources when evaluating such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.', "In some cases, the prompt might not adequately consider the nature of the statement as either a factual claim or an opinion. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about Gov. Terry McAuliffe's desire to be in a Cabinet position is more of an aspiration or intention rather than a factual claim. The prompt's strict criteria for factual verification might have led to an incorrect prediction.", "In Example 2, the statement about Rep. Justin Amash's voting patterns is a factual claim that can be verified through official records. The context from a reputable news outlet like Politico adds credibility, but the prompt’s focus on the speaker's job title as a commentator may have overshadowed the need to evaluate the statement's factual accuracy directly.", 'Example 3 involves Jeff Greene commenting on going to Cuba, which is a factual statement about a personal action. The lack of any job title or specific context that would suggest it\'s an opinion or a misleading statement should result in a "No" prediction. The prompt might have assumed too much about the speaker\'s credibility without properly assessing the statement\'s content.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Planned Parenthood acknowledging Joe Straus for his efforts is a direct quote from a letter, which is a primary source. The prompt’s caution about verifying claims against reliable data or sources might have led to an incorrect prediction if it did not prioritize the veracity of the direct quote over the potential bias of the nonprofit organization.', 'For Example 5, the statement about high-speed rail creating jobs is a factual claim that requires verification against economic data or reports. The context of a debate does not inherently make the statement less credible; the prediction should be based on the factual basis of the claim rather than the medium in which it is presented. The prompt might have undervalued the importance of fact-checking such claims.', "The prompt's focus on the broader implications and credibility of information can sometimes lead to overthinking, causing it to miss straightforward factual truths. In Example 6, the prompt incorrectly labeled a statement about personal travel as false, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the simplicity and directness of the claim, which does not require extensive analysis.", 'Example 5 involves a statement about the national language and its implications for multilingual services, which is a complex issue that can vary widely depending on the location and local policies. The prompt might be missing the nuance and context-specific nature of such statements, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'The prompt could have overlooked the distinction between factual claims and general assertions, especially in the context of political commentary or media interviews. Statements like "we\'ve broken all-time records" or "polls show Hillary Clinton winning" are often based on the speaker\'s interpretation or predictions, and should be evaluated based on the speaker\'s credibility and the context, rather than their absolute verifiability.', 'In Examples 2 and 7, the statements involve legal advice, which can be subjective and context-dependent. The prompt should consider the reliability of the source more critically in such cases, as legal advice often requires specialized knowledge and context that may not always be evident from the given information.'] items,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Consider the reliability of the source, the nature of the context, the expertise or role of the speaker, and whether the statement is a factual claim or an opinion. Be cautious of hyperbole or exaggeration used for rhetorical effect, especially in contexts that suggest a lighter tone or entertainment value. Take into account the broader implications and the credibility of the information presented, including the timing and manner of the disclosure or the sources cited. Evaluate the type of publication or platform where the statement is made to better gauge its veracity. Additionally, assess the potential bias of the source and how it might influence the statement. Prioritize the credibility of the source based on their position and the context of the statement, and verify the veracity of specific claims against known facts and reputable sources. 

Be mindful of the dynamic nature of information and consider how it might change over time. Some statements may be accurate at the moment they are made but become outdated due to new developments or research. 

Recognize that the expertise and professional background of the speaker can significantly influence the truthfulness of their statement. For example, a lawyer's opinion on legal matters should be evaluated based on legal expertise rather than general context alone.

When evaluating factual claims, verify them independently using reliable sources. For instance, a politician's claim about property taxes can be checked against public records to ensure accuracy.

Provide your judgment with due consideration to all these factors, keeping in mind the potential biases and the evolving nature of information.
