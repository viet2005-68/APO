LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be too simplistic, expecting a binary "lie" or "not a lie" without considering the nuances of the context, job title, and party affiliation. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about New Jersey\'s tenure law reform could be factually correct but the prediction being "No" suggests the model didn\'t account for the speaker\'s role as the Governor, who would have direct influence over such reforms.', 'In Example 1, the model might not have correctly interpreted the context as an opinion piece, leading it to incorrectly label the statement as false. Opinion pieces often contain subjective views rather than verifiable facts, which the model might not recognize.', 'Example 2 highlights that the model might be overly literal and miss the intended meaning. The statement reflects personal experience rather than a factual claim, which the model could interpret as a lie due to its lack of verifiability.', 'For Example 4, the model might not have considered the context of political debates where statements are often hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The model may need to understand that such statements are common in political rhetoric and should not always be taken at face value.', 'In Example 5, the model might have struggled with the context of an interview, where statements can be based on personal beliefs or opinions rather than verifiable facts.

For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, but the prompt\'s generic approach might lead to the incorrect prediction of "No". The model needs to be more nuanced in how it interprets the relationship between the statement and the given context.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity in the job titles and roles. In Example 4, the Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws would likely be accurate, especially if the context is a speech at a reputable institution. The model might need better training to recognize the credibility of statements based on the speaker’s position and the context.', 'The prompt might also be failing due to insufficient understanding of political and economic contexts. In Example 5, the statement about Medicare passing with little Republican support could be true based on historical facts, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to determine this accurately without additional context or training.', 'In Examples 6 and 8, the model might be struggling with identifying factual statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. For Example 6, the governor discussing income taxes in Ohio compared to Texas and Oklahoma might be accurate based on known policies, but the model’s generic approach might lead to a false negative.', "Lastly, the model might be overgeneralizing the accuracy of statements made by public figures, regardless of the context. In Example 7, the statement about the deficit being largely due to past policies and the recession could be true, but the model might not account for the complexities of economic policy or the speaker's credibility well enough."]

3. Account for the role and influence of the speaker, such as a Governor or elected official, in making policy-related statements.
4. Distinguish between verifiable facts and subjective opinions.
5. Interpret the relationship between the statement and the given context, taking into account the specific details and nuances provided.

For example, if a statement attributes a position on Planned Parenthood to a candidate who has not officially stated such a position, classify it as a lie. If a statement about a right-wing group's spending in the primary election is verified against financial records, classify it accordingly. If a statement made by a Governor about New Jersey's tenure law reform is factually correct but the prediction is "No," re-evaluate the context and the speaker's role in the statement.,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the provided Context and other information. A lie is defined as a statement that is deliberately false or misleading. Consider the following factors when making your determination: the speaker's job title, their party affiliation, the context of the statement, and any relevant historical or factual background. Be cautious of hyperbolic or exaggerated statements common in political rhetoric and personal narratives. Ensure that the statement aligns with known facts and can be substantiated by reliable sources. If the statement cannot be verified or is misleading, classify it as a lie.

  feedbacks: ['The prompt may be too simplistic, expecting a binary "lie" or "not a lie" without considering the nuances of the context, job title, and party affiliation. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about New Jersey\'s tenure law reform could be factually correct but the prediction being "No" suggests the model didn\'t account for the speaker\'s role as the Governor, who would have direct influence over such reforms.', 'In Example 1, the model might not have correctly interpreted the context as an opinion piece, leading it to incorrectly label the statement as false. Opinion pieces often contain subjective views rather than verifiable facts, which the model might not recognize.', 'Example 2 highlights that the model might be overly literal and miss the intended meaning. The statement reflects personal experience rather than a factual claim, which the model could interpret as a lie due to its lack of verifiability.', 'For Example 4, the model might not have considered the context of political debates where statements are often hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The model may need to understand that such statements are common in political rhetoric and should not always be taken at face value.', 'In Example 5, the model might have struggled with the context of an interview, where statements can be based on personal beliefs or opinions rather than verifiable facts. The model needs to better distinguish between factual claims and personal narratives.', 'The prompt may be failing because it does not adequately consider the context and specific details provided in each example. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, but the prompt\'s generic approach might lead to the incorrect prediction of "No". The model needs to be more nuanced in how it interprets the relationship between the statement and the given context.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity in the job titles and roles. In Example 4, the Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws would likely be accurate, especially if the context is a speech at a reputable institution. The model might need better training to recognize the credibility of statements based on the speaker’s position and the context.', 'The prompt might also be failing due to insufficient understanding of political and economic contexts. In Example 5, the statement about Medicare passing with little Republican support could be true based on historical facts, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to determine this accurately without additional context or training.', 'In Examples 6 and 8, the model might be struggling with identifying factual statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. For Example 6, the governor discussing income taxes in Ohio compared to Texas and Oklahoma might be accurate based on known policies, but the model’s generic approach might lead to a false negative.', "Lastly, the model might be overgeneralizing the accuracy of statements made by public figures, regardless of the context. In Example 7, the statement about the deficit being largely due to past policies and the recession could be true, but the model might not account for the complexities of economic policy or the speaker's credibility well enough.", 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in defining what constitutes a lie. It does not clearly outline the criteria for determining if a statement is false based on the context, job title, party affiliation, or the source of the statement. This ambiguity leads to inconsistent interpretations and incorrect predictions.', 'The prompt does not account for the reliability of sources or the accuracy of information provided. For instance, statements made by politicians or public figures may contain inaccuracies due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation, which the current prompt does not consider.', 'The prompt fails to address the temporal aspect of the information. Statements made in the past might be true at the time but become false later due to changes in circumstances. Without considering the current status or recent developments, the classifier may incorrectly label statements as lies.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between opinions and factual statements. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, leading to misclassification. The classifier needs to distinguish between statements that are verifiable facts versus subjective opinions.', 'The prompt does not provide guidelines on how to handle conflicting information or multiple pieces of evidence. In cases where there is contradictory information, the classifier should weigh the evidence before making a determination, rather than relying solely on the given context.', 'In Example 2, the statement comparing hunting and fishing license holders to voters might be a lie if the actual data shows a different ratio. The classifier needs to check against real data or reliable sources to determine the veracity of such claims, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', "Example 3 involves a statement about a right-wing group's spending in the primary election. This might be a lie if the group did not spend as much as claimed. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify claims against known financial records or statements from the relevant parties.", "For Example 4, the statement about Danny Tarkanian's positions on Planned Parenthood and abortion rights might be misleading if the candidate has not officially stated these positions. The classifier needs to differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations.", 'In Example 5, the statement about the Democratic National Convention’s lack of mentions on ISIS might be a lie if the convention did indeed discuss the topic. The classifier should be instructed to cross-check against official transcripts or reports from the event to ensure the statement aligns with the actual content.'] items,

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the credibility of the speaker or the source of the information. In Example 1, the speaker is a Democrat in a debate, which might influence the statement's accuracy. The prompt should consider the speaker's role and party affiliation, especially in political contexts, to better assess the reliability of the claim.", 'The context provided in some examples, such as Example 6, might not always include enough information to verify the claim. The prompt should emphasize the importance of cross-referencing the statement with multiple reliable sources, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', 'The prompt focuses too much on whether the statement is supported by data or contradicts available data, but it does not adequately address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements. Examples like Example 4, where the statement mentions a future event, might be more about aspiration rather than a factual claim, and thus should not necessarily be labeled as false without additional context.', 'The prompt does not explicitly consider the nature of the source of the information. In Example 7, the statement is attributed to a retired police captain and a commentary in a newspaper, which might not be as reliable as an official document or a recent press release. The prompt should include a clause that considers the reliability of different types of sources.', 'The prompt fails to acknowledge the distinction between absolute and relative statements. In Example 8, while the statement about the five Democratic state senators might be factually incorrect, it could still be a true relative statement if the number of senators in favor or against the bill has changed over time. The prompt should clarify how to handle relative claims versus absolute claims.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly focuses on the reliability of the claim being supported by real data or official records, which can be subjective and varies greatly depending on the topic. In some cases, the statement might be a common belief or a specific claim within a certain context that doesn't necessarily need to be backed by official records to be considered accurate. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about having more children's hospitals might be a well-known fact within Ohio, even if it isn't widely reported in national data. The prompt needs to account for such contextual and local truths.", "The prompt might also be too rigid in its approach, failing to recognize that some statements can be true based on specific, unverified claims or personal experiences, especially when made by individuals with relevant job titles or contexts. In Example 3, the Congresswoman's statement is based on her experience and position, even though it contradicts official data. The prompt should allow for such subjective or experiential truths, especially when they come from credible sources.", "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to handle complex claims that involve historical data or specific events. In Example 4, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes might be true based on historical actions or statements, even if it hasn't been officially recorded. The prompt needs to consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, rather than just verifiable data.", "The prompt might not adequately address the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. In Example 5, the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level, even if it doesn't hold up when aggregated nationally. The prompt should recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.", "The prompt may be too focused on the source of the information rather than the accuracy and context of the statement itself. In Example 7, the retired police captain's statement about law-enforcement officers dying 10 years earlier than the general population might be based on his extensive experience, making it a true statement despite not being widely documented in official records. The prompt should prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt\'s definition of "real data" and "official records" might be too narrow, leading to misclassification. In Example 1, while Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team may seem subjective, it could still be considered a factual claim if supported by recent census data or sports league records, which the prompt does not explicitly consider reliable.', 'The prompt’s approach to verifying claims through reliable sources might be inconsistent or overly strict. In Example 2, the prediction "Yes" suggests a lack of verification from official sources like government reports or health care spending data, which might be necessary for accurate classification.', 'The prompt’s criteria for distinguishing between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations might be too rigid. In Example 3, the statement about local governments requiring high percentages of health insurance premiums seems more factual and verifiable through public records or policy documents, which the prompt did not correctly identify.', "The prompt’s reliance on the context and specific details provided might not always align with the nature of the claim itself. In Example 4, the statement about having more children's hospitals than any other state is a factual claim that could be verified through medical facilities data, which the prompt did not recognize as needing further fact-checking.", 'The prompt’s treatment of political statements and campaign rhetoric might be overly skeptical. In Example 7, the statement about eliminating the Department of Education in a campaign commercial should be classified based on the political context rather than its factual verifiability, which the prompt did not account for.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not adequately account for the nature and credibility of the sources providing the statements. For example, in Example 1, the statement about Donald Trump being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists is likely from a news source or interview, which might not be verified facts but rather opinions or unverified reports. The prompt\'s strict adherence to "real data or official records" may cause it to misclassify such statements as false when they are actually based on credible but unverified information.', 'In Example 2, the statement about economic and social mobility is from a fundraising letter, which is typically aimed at soliciting donations rather than providing accurate statistical data. The prompt\'s focus on "official records" might lead it to overlook the nature of the source and incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a subjective claim meant to evoke a response rather than present verifiable facts.', 'Example 3 involves a campaign commercial, which is known for presenting claims that may not be fully substantiated. The prompt\'s criteria for classifying statements as true or false based on "evidence or official records" may not apply well to campaign advertisements, where the goal is often to persuade rather than provide accurate information. This can result in misclassification of the statement as false.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Congressman Nye voting against a bill is from his own website, which is a primary source for his actions and positions. However, the prompt might be too rigid in its requirement for "official records," leading it to miss the fact that Congressman Nye himself is the most authoritative source for his voting record, thus incorrectly labeling the statement as false.', 'Example 5 involves a statement made during a major foreign policy speech, which is a formal and public address. While the statement is attributed to a future President-Elect, the context suggests it is a policy position rather than a personal opinion. The prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations might lead it to incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a policy stance.']

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define how to evaluate the credibility of the statement based on the context and the reliability of the speaker. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about health insurance subsidies might be fact-checked using official documents, but the prompt does not specify this process. Similarly, in Example 2, the specific details provided about spending on abstinence programs and lost federal funds require verification against official records, which the prompt fails to emphasize.', 'Another reason could be the lack of explicit guidelines on how to handle statements made in different media formats. The prompt mentions context like a radio talk show, web video, or TV debate, but it does not provide clear instructions on how to assess the credibility of a statement based on the medium it was presented in. This ambiguity led to incorrect predictions in Examples 1 through 7, where the context plays a crucial role in evaluating the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt also lacks clarity in defining what constitutes "reliable" sources. In Example 8, the statement about opposition to the war in Iraq could be verified using historical records and speeches, but without specifying the need to cross-reference with reliable historical data, the prediction might have been incorrect. The prompt should include a more detailed explanation of how to identify and use credible sources.', 'Additionally, the prompt does not specify how to weigh the credibility of the speaker. In Examples 3 and 4, the statements were made by political figures, and their credibility should be assessed based on their position and past actions. However, the current prompt does not provide guidance on how to incorporate this aspect into the evaluation process, leading to inaccurate predictions.', 'Lastly, the prompt does not address how to handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking. Examples like Example 5, where the statement claims a relative position among developed countries, require a different approach compared to statements that can be directly verified with current data. The prompt should include instructions on how to evaluate such statements, especially when they involve comparisons or projections.']

In Example 1, the statement about giving children aspirin and the mention of abortion are both factually incorrect, yet the prediction is wrong. This suggests that the prompt might not adequately account for the complexity and sometimes controversial nature of statements made in political contexts.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Jews receiving notices in Ukraine is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently consider the historical context and the verifiability of such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.', "Example 3 involves a statement about Pat Toomey's advocacy for eliminating corporate taxes, which is not accurate according to available information.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the nature and context of the statement itself.

The prompt might be too quick to label such claims as lies without proper verification. It should encourage more nuanced evaluation rather than a binary yes/no decision.', 'In Example 2, the statement about halting EPA regulation helping stop rising gas prices could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts. The prompt may not adequately handle such cases where the statement is a political oversimplification rather than a factual error. It should recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false.', 'Example 3 involves a historical fact about the slave trade, which is a well-documented event with reliable historical records. The prompt’s failure to correctly identify this as a true statement suggests it may not prioritize established historical facts over other types of claims. Historical verifications should be a key part of the evaluation process.', 'Example 4 deals with a complex economic claim about corporate tax deductions, which requires a thorough understanding of tax laws and economic policies. The prompt may lack the depth needed to accurately assess such specialized information, leading to incorrect labeling. It should include a mechanism for verifying claims through expert knowledge or detailed research.', 'Examples like 5, 6, 7, and 8 involve statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites. These statements often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation that is common in such settings.

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context, the reliability of sources, and the accuracy of the information provided. When faced with conflicting information or multiple pieces of evidence, weigh the evidence carefully to make a well-informed decision. Consider the role and credibility of the speaker, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. 

Understand that statements in political contexts may be hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect and should not always be taken at face value. Distinguish between absolute and relative claims; a statement might be factually incorrect but still true in a relative sense if the conditions have changed. To evaluate such claims, cross-reference with relevant data or historical records. 

When evaluating statements that compare groups (like hunting and fishing license holders to voters), ensure you have accurate and up-to-date data to support your assessment. Statements based on personal beliefs or opinions, as in interviews, should be distinguished from factual claims. Use the available context and any additional credible sources to make a determination, and account for the possibility that a statement might be a lie even if it aligns with the speaker's personal narrative.,

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may be too rigid in its approach, potentially overlooking the nuances in political statements where exaggeration or hyperbole is common. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about increasing spending by $12.5 billion might be seen as hyperbolic in a political context, which the model did not account for, leading to a misclassification.', "In Example 2, the statement about medication and abortion might be considered a matter of personal opinion rather than a clear lie, especially in a political debate setting. The model's strict criteria for determining a lie might not accommodate such complex and subjective topics, leading to incorrect classification.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of insufficient context for accurate judgment. Without knowing the specific details of the memo and the actions taken after receiving it, classifying the statement as a lie might be premature. The model needs to better handle situations where there is limited information available.', 'In Example 4, the statement about isolated voter incidents might be seen as a general claim rather than a verifiable fact. Political rhetoric often includes generalizations that may not align with strict factual standards. The model should be more flexible in distinguishing between general claims and verifiable lies.', 'Example 5 showcases the challenge of verifying statements in a timely manner. By the time the statement was made, the relevant data may not yet be available or fully processed. The model should be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the context being explicitly labeled with job title, state, party, and other details, which are not always available or accurate. This rigidity can lead to misinterpretation or incorrect classification if some key information is missing or misunderstood.', 'The prompt might also be too focused on political contexts and affiliations, which can result in overlooking other types of misleading statements, especially those in non-political settings like media interviews or campaign ads. For example, in Example 8, the statement about incarceration rates is not necessarily a political claim but still requires verification against factual data.', 'The prompt’s emphasis on verifying statements with “reliable sources” might be too stringent, leading to incorrect classifications when the source of the statement is credible but not widely recognized. In Example 1, the statement about Virginia spending on abstinence programs might be correct according to internal state records, even if not widely publicized.', 'The prompt’s cautionary approach towards hyperbolic or exaggerated statements might cause it to incorrectly label statements as lies when they are actually exaggerations for effect rather than deliberate falsehoods. Examples like Example 7, where a radio personality makes a statement that might be seen as hyperbolic but is not necessarily false, could be misclassified.', 'The prompt might not account well for the nuance in language and the complexity of real-world situations. Statements can be misleading without being outright lies, such as in Example 4 where the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the speaker's job title, party affiliation, and context without providing clear guidelines on how to interpret these factors.

Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about domestic violence as the second leading cause of death for women under 50 could be misleading if the source of the claim is unreliable or if the claim itself is not supported by statistical evidence, which the prompt does not address adequately.", 'The prompt does not clearly define what constitutes a "lie" in various contexts, especially in political rhetoric where hyperbole and exaggeration are common. In Example 3, the statement about fraudulent election registrations might be misleading if the claim is based on unverified or biased sources, yet the prompt does not specify how to evaluate such claims critically. Similarly, in Example 6, the claim about increased spending by $12.5 billion might be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of actual policy plans, but the prompt lacks a mechanism to distinguish between legitimate policy proposals and misleading claims.', "The prompt's criteria for determining a lie do not account for the nuance and complexity of political discourse. In Example 7, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for the elimination of all corporate taxes is likely to be a simplification or exaggeration of his actual stance, but the prompt does not provide guidance on how to recognize and evaluate such simplifications in political rhetoric. This oversight leads to misclassification, as the prompt fails to consider the context and intent behind the statement.", "The prompt does not provide a clear method for verifying historical or factual background information, which is crucial for determining the truthfulness of a statement. In Example 4, the claim about having the most children's hospitals might be true or false depending on accurate and up-to-date data, but the prompt does not instruct on how to access or verify such data. Without these instructions, the classifier is likely to make incorrect judgments based on incomplete or outdated information.", "The prompt's reliance on the context of the statement, such as a fundraising letter or a press release, does not ensure a consistent approach to evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. In Example 8, the statement about the number of countries bombed by different presidents might be a simplified or misleading statistic, but the prompt does not provide a way to verify the accuracy of such claims in the context of a tweet. This lack of specificity in handling different types of contexts can lead to misclassification of statements that are actually truthful but presented in a misleading manner."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define what constitutes a "lie" in the context of political statements and personal narratives. Political statements often contain exaggerations and hyperbole that are common rhetorical devices, which the current prompt does not account for adequately. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the American slave trade is factually accurate, but the prompt might not recognize this due to its strict definition of a lie. Similarly, the other examples involve statements that, while potentially exaggerated or misleading, are not necessarily lies in the strict sense intended by the prompt.', "The prompt's reliance on historical and factual background may lead to incorrect classifications if the necessary information is not readily available or if the background knowledge required to verify the statement is not provided. In Examples 3, 4, 5, and 7, the predictions were incorrect because the prompt did not consider the possibility that the statements, although potentially misleading, might be true based on unverified or unknown facts.

This oversight could lead to misclassification, as the credibility of a statement can be significantly influenced by the speaker's position and political alignment.", 'The prompt\'s focus on verifiable facts and reliable sources might lead to incorrect classifications when dealing with subjective or opinion-based statements. In Examples 1, 3, and 5, the statements might be factually correct but still be classified as lies because they are not supported by "known facts" as defined by the prompt. The prompt needs to be more inclusive of different types of evidence and the nature of the claims being made, rather than strictly relying on verifiable data.']

For example, statements about policy impacts should be assessed based on the overall context and potential unintended consequences. Ensure that the statement aligns with known facts and can be substantiated by reliable sources. If the statement cannot be verified or is misleading, classify it as a lie. Additionally, consider the reliability and scope of the data sources used to verify claims, including real-time data, government reports, and reputable academic studies. 

If the statement appears to be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts, evaluate its accuracy within the broader context of the issue. For instance, statements about regulatory changes and their economic effects should be carefully examined for their validity and comprehensiveness.,

Handle statements that are technically correct but may be incomplete or potentially misleading by considering the broader context and implications. Statements from politicians who have changed their positions over time should be evaluated in light of their evolving stances. To verify claims made by political figures, consult official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure the accuracy of the statement.,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Ensure that your classification takes into account the following factors:

1. **Temporal Accuracy**: Verify the statement against current events or recent developments, as information can change over time.
2. **Official Sources**: Cross-check the statement against official transcripts, reports, or reliable databases to confirm its accuracy.
3. **Data Consistency**: If the statement involves statistical claims, compare it with real data or reliable sources to verify the numbers.
4. **Contextual Clarity**: Recognize when the statement is part of an opinion piece or a subjective view, and avoid labeling it as a lie unless it contradicts factual information.
5. **Relevant Information**: Consider the job title, party affiliation, or any other relevant background information that might influence the statement's validity.

For instance, if the statement claims that the Democratic National Convention did not discuss ISIS, check official transcripts or reports from the event to verify this claim. If the statement compares the number of hunting and fishing license holders to voters, refer to the most recent census data or official statistics to validate the comparison.

Based on these considerations, provide your final prediction (Yes or No) along with a brief explanation for your decision.

For example, in Example 1, the statement about the drop-out rate is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of data, but without specific data to compare, the prompt might miss recognizing this as a lie due to the lack of immediate verifiable figures. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about domestic violence as the second leading cause of death for women under 50 is plausible and supported by various studies, so the prompt might incorrectly label it as false.', "Another reason could be the prompt's strict adherence to temporal accuracy, which might not always apply to statements made in historical or hypothetical contexts. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about notices sent to Jews in Ukraine is based on historical events that may not have immediate verifiable data, making it difficult to classify as a lie without additional context or sources.", 'The prompt also might fail to recognize the nuances in political discourse, where statements are often opinions rather than verifiable facts. Examples like Example 4, where the statement about a future Speaker of the House having limited electoral experience, are common political rhetoric and might be considered truthful within the context of political campaigning, even if the actual experience does not match the claim.', 'In cases involving expert opinion, such as Example 7 and Example 8, the prompt might not adequately consider the expertise of the speaker. Statements made by a doctor or a political figure on specific topics related to their expertise might be accepted as true, even if they are not factually accurate according to external data. The prompt should recognize that some statements are based on professional knowledge and might require different criteria for evaluation.', 'Lastly, the prompt might struggle with statements that are partially true but exaggerated or misleading. For instance, in Example 5, the statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation. The prompt needs to better account for the intent behind the statement and how it aligns with the facts, rather than just the verifiability of each component.']

However, also consider the broader implications and context of the action taken, as sometimes the statement might be accurate but misleading due to the complexity of the issue.

Based on these considerations, provide your final prediction (Yes or No) along with a brief explanation for your decision.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Your classification should take into account the following factors:

1. **Temporal Accuracy**: Verify the statement against current events or recent developments, as information can change over time.
2. **Official Sources**: Cross-check the statement against official transcripts, reports, or reliable databases to confirm its accuracy.
3. **Data Consistency**: If the statement involves statistical claims, compare it with real data or reliable sources to verify the numbers.
4. **Contextual Clarity**: Recognize when the statement is part of an opinion piece or a subjective view, and avoid labeling it as a lie unless it contradicts factual information.
5. **Relevant Information**: Consider the job title, party affiliation, or any other relevant background information that might influence the statement's validity.
6. **Handling Conflicting Evidence**: When faced with contradictory information, weigh the evidence carefully before making a determination. Consider the credibility and reliability of each source.
7. **Absolute vs. Relative Claims**: Differentiate between absolute and relative statements. An absolute claim is one that is definitively true or false, while a relative claim is one that is true or false depending on the context or timeframe. Absolute claims require strict verification, whereas relative claims should be evaluated based on the specific context provided.
8. **Nature of the Source**: Consider the type of document or communication from which the statement is taken. Fundraising letters, personal opinions, and historical accounts may have different purposes and should be evaluated accordingly.

For example, if the statement claims that the Democratic National Convention did not discuss ISIS, check official transcripts or reports from the event to verify this claim. If the statement compares the number of hunting and fishing license holders to voters, refer to the most recent census data or official statistics to validate the comparison.

If the statement involves a subjective opinion, such as economic and social mobility in Example 2, evaluate whether the statement is meant to evoke a response or present verifiable facts. In such cases, the statement may not be a lie if it reflects a genuine perspective, even if it is not strictly factual.

Historical claims, like the statement about Jews receiving notices in Ukraine, should be verified against historical records and primary sources. If the claim is supported by credible historical evidence, it should be labeled as true.

6. **Intent and Context**: Assess the overall intent behind the statement and how it aligns with known facts. Be cautious of statements that exaggerate or misrepresent the truth, even if some parts are technically true.
7. **Speaker Credibility**: Evaluate the credibility of the speaker based on their role, expertise, and historical track record. Political figures, for example, may have biases that affect the accuracy of their statements.
8. **Specificity and Detail**: Look for specific details that can be verified independently. Vague statements should be treated with skepticism until they can be substantiated.

For instance, if the statement claims that the Democratic National Convention did not discuss ISIS, check official transcripts or reports from the event to verify this claim. If the statement compares the number of hunting and fishing license holders to voters, refer to the most recent census data or official statistics to validate the comparison. If the statement is made by a politician during a debate, consider their party affiliation and historical statements to determine their credibility.

5. **Relevant Information**: Consider the job title, party affiliation, or any other relevant background information that might influence the statement's validity. For example, a statement made by a politician might reflect their policy stance rather than a verifiable fact.
6. **Technical Correctness**: Evaluate whether the statement is technically correct but potentially misleading or incomplete. For instance, a statement about minimum wages being low compared to other countries should consider the overall economic context and living standards.
7. **Future Projections**: Statements about future events should be evaluated based on the likelihood of them coming true, rather than labeling them as false without context. Aspirational statements might not be factually false if they are meant to inspire action.

For instance, if the statement claims that the Democratic National Convention did not discuss ISIS, check official transcripts or reports from the event to verify this claim. If the statement compares the number of hunting and fishing license holders to voters, refer to the most recent census data or official statistics to validate the comparison.

If the statement is about a future event, consider the likelihood of it happening based on current trends and projections. If the statement involves opinion or subjective views, ensure that it aligns with factual information before concluding it as a lie.

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information provided. Ensure that your classification takes into account the following factors:

1. **Temporal Accuracy**: Verify the statement against current events or recent developments, as information can change over time. Consider the context in which the statement was made and the timeline of events.
2. **Official Sources**: Cross-check the statement against official transcripts, reports, or reliable databases to confirm its accuracy. Be mindful of the nature of the source, such as whether it is a subjective opinion piece or a factual report.
3. **Data Consistency**: If the statement involves statistical claims, compare it with real data or reliable sources to verify the numbers. Recognize that data availability and processing times can affect the accuracy of the statement.
4. **Contextual Clarity**: Recognize when the statement is part of an opinion piece or a subjective view, and avoid labeling it as a lie unless it contradicts factual information. Understand the intent behind the statement, whether it is meant to evoke a response or present verifiable facts.
5. **Relevant Information**: Consider the job title, party affiliation, or any other relevant background information that might influence the statement's validity. Use this information to contextualize the statement appropriately.

For instance, if the statement claims that the Democratic National Convention did not discuss ISIS, check official transcripts or reports from the event to verify this claim. If the statement compares the number of hunting and fishing license holders to voters, refer to the most recent census data or official statistics to validate the comparison. 

If the statement is from a fundraising letter, consider the nature of the document and whether it is intended to solicit donations rather than provide accurate statistical data. For example, if Jeff Merkley's statement about the Democratic National Convention discussing ISIS is a subjective opinion, classify it accordingly without directly verifying the content.

By taking these factors into account, provide your final prediction (Yes or No) along with a brief explanation for your decision.

The statement reflects personal experience rather than a factual claim, which the model could interpret as a lie due to its lack of verifiability.', 'For Example 4, the model might not have considered the context of political debates where statements are often hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The model may need to understand that such statements are common in political rhetoric and should not always be taken at face value.', 'In Example 5, the model might have struggled with the context of an interview, where statements can be based on personal beliefs or opinions rather than verifiable facts.

For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, but the prompt\'s generic approach might lead to the incorrect prediction of "No". The model needs to be more nuanced in how it interprets the relationship between the statement and the given context.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity in the job titles and roles. In Example 4, the Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws would likely be accurate, especially if the context is a speech at a reputable institution. The model might need better training to recognize the credibility of statements based on the speaker’s position and the context.', 'The prompt might also be failing due to insufficient understanding of political and economic contexts. In Example 5, the statement about Medicare passing with little Republican support could be true based on historical facts, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to determine this accurately without additional context or training.', 'In Examples 6 and 8, the model might be struggling with identifying factual statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. For Example 6, the governor discussing income taxes in Ohio compared to Texas and Oklahoma might be accurate based on known policies, but the model’s generic approach might lead to a false negative.', "Lastly, the model might be overgeneralizing the accuracy of statements made by public figures, regardless of the context. In Example 7, the statement about the deficit being largely due to past policies and the recession could be true, but the model might not account for the complexities of economic policy or the speaker's credibility well enough.", 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in defining what constitutes a lie. It does not clearly outline the criteria for determining if a statement is false based on the context, job title, party affiliation, or the source of the statement. This ambiguity leads to inconsistent interpretations and incorrect predictions.', 'The prompt does not account for the reliability of sources or the accuracy of information provided. For instance, statements made by politicians or public figures may contain inaccuracies due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation, which the current prompt does not consider.', 'The prompt fails to address the temporal aspect of the information. Statements made in the past might be true at the time but become false later due to changes in circumstances. Without considering the current status or recent developments, the classifier may incorrectly label statements as lies.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between opinions and factual statements. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, leading to misclassification. The classifier needs to distinguish between statements that are verifiable facts versus subjective opinions.', 'The prompt does not provide guidelines on how to handle conflicting information or multiple pieces of evidence. In cases where there is contradictory information, the classifier should weigh the evidence before making a determination, rather than relying solely on the given context.', 'In Example 2, the statement comparing hunting and fishing license holders to voters might be a lie if the actual data shows a different ratio. The classifier needs to check against real data or reliable sources to determine the veracity of such claims, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', "Example 3 involves a statement about a right-wing group's spending in the primary election. This might be a lie if the group did not spend as much as claimed. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify claims against known financial records or statements from the relevant parties.", "For Example 4, the statement about Danny Tarkanian's positions on Planned Parenthood and abortion rights might be misleading if the candidate has not officially stated these positions. The classifier needs to differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations.", 'In Example 5, the statement about the Democratic National Convention’s lack of mentions on ISIS might be a lie if the convention did indeed discuss the topic. The classifier should be instructed to cross-check against official transcripts or reports from the event to ensure the statement aligns with the actual content.', "The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the credibility of the speaker or the source of the information. In Example 1, the speaker is a Democrat in a debate, which might influence the statement's accuracy. The prompt should consider the speaker's role and party affiliation, especially in political contexts, to better assess the reliability of the claim.", 'The context provided in some examples, such as Example 6, might not always include enough information to verify the claim. The prompt should emphasize the importance of cross-referencing the statement with multiple reliable sources, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', 'The prompt focuses too much on whether the statement is supported by data or contradicts available data, but it does not adequately address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements. Examples like Example 4, where the statement mentions a future event, might be more about aspiration rather than a factual claim, and thus should not necessarily be labeled as false without additional context.', 'The prompt fails to acknowledge the distinction between absolute and relative statements. In Example 8, while the statement about the five Democratic state senators might be factually incorrect, it could still be a true relative statement if the number of senators in favor or against the bill has changed over time. The prompt should clarify how to handle relative claims versus absolute claims.', "The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly focuses on the reliability of the claim being supported by real data or official records, which can be subjective and varies greatly depending on the topic. In some cases, the statement might be a common belief or a specific claim within a certain context that doesn't necessarily need to be backed by official records to be considered accurate. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about having more children's hospitals might be a well-known fact within Ohio, even if it isn't widely reported in national data. The prompt needs to account for such contextual and local truths.", "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to handle complex claims that involve historical data or specific events. In Example 4, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes might be true based on historical actions or statements, even if it hasn't been officially recorded. The prompt needs to consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, rather than just verifiable data.", "The prompt might not adequately address the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. In Example 5, the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level, even if it doesn't hold up when aggregated nationally. The prompt should recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.", "The prompt may be too focused on the source of the information rather than the accuracy and context of the statement itself. In Example 7, the retired police captain's statement about law-enforcement officers dying 10 years earlier than the general population might be based on his extensive experience, making it a true statement despite not being widely documented in official records. The prompt should prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone.", 'The prompt\'s definition of "real data" and "official records" might be too narrow, leading to misclassification. In Example 1, while Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team may seem subjective, it could still be considered a factual claim if supported by recent census data or sports league records, which the prompt does not explicitly consider reliable.', 'The prompt’s approach to verifying claims through reliable sources might be inconsistent or overly strict. In Example 2, the prediction "Yes" suggests a lack of verification from official sources like government reports or health care spending data, which might be necessary for accurate classification.', 'The prompt’s treatment of political statements and campaign rhetoric might be overly skeptical. In Example 7, the statement about eliminating the Department of Education in a campaign commercial should be classified based on the political context rather than its factual verifiability, which the prompt did not account for.', 'In Example 2, the statement about economic and social mobility is from a fundraising letter, which is typically aimed at soliciting donations rather than providing accurate statistical data. The prompt\'s focus on "official records" might lead it to overlook the nature of the source and incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a subjective claim meant to evoke a response rather than present verifiable facts.', 'Example 3 involves a campaign commercial, which is known for presenting claims that may not be fully substantiated. The prompt\'s criteria for classifying statements as true or false based on "evidence or official records" may not apply well to campaign advertisements, where the goal is often to persuade rather than provide accurate information. This can result in misclassification of the statement as false.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Congressman Nye voting against a bill is from his own website, which is a primary source for his actions and positions. However, the prompt might be too rigid in its requirement for "official records," leading it to miss the fact that Congressman Nye himself is the most authoritative source for his voting record, thus incorrectly labeling the statement as false.', 'Example 5 involves a statement made during a major foreign policy speech, which is a formal and public address. While the statement is attributed to a future President-Elect, the context suggests it is a policy position rather than a personal opinion. The prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations might lead it to incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a policy stance.', 'The prompt might be too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the complexity of political contexts where statements can be true but misleading depending on the audience or the issue at hand. For instance, statements about healthcare reform can be accurate even if some aspects of the implementation are controversial or misunderstood.', 'The prompt could be missing guidance on how to handle statements that are technically correct but incomplete or potentially misleading. For example, statements about minimum wages being low compared to other countries might be true, but the comparison should consider the overall economic context and living standards.', "The prompt does not specify how to handle statements from politicians who have changed their positions over time. It should include a consideration of the speaker's evolving stance and how that affects the truthfulness of their current statement.", 'The prompt lacks a clear method for verifying claims made by political figures, especially when those claims are part of a broader narrative or campaign. It should include instructions on cross-referencing claims with official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure the accuracy of the statement.', 'Lastly, the prompt does not address how to handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking. Examples like Example 5, where the statement claims a relative position among developed countries, require a different approach compared to statements that can be directly verified with current data. The prompt should include instructions on how to evaluate such statements, especially when they involve comparisons or projections.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Jews receiving notices in Ukraine is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently consider the historical context and the verifiability of such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Obama and Bush bombing countries is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not properly weigh the credibility of the source or the historical accuracy of the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 5 discusses campaign contributions from electric utilities, which is a factual claim that should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently prioritize the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in a political setting, which could result in an incorrect prediction.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the nature and context of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the claim about cancer deaths being higher than 3,000 daily in the U.S. is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of statistics, but the statement is not inherently false without evidence. The prompt might be too quick to label such claims as lies without proper verification. It should encourage more nuanced evaluation rather than a binary yes/no decision.', 'In Example 2, the statement about halting EPA regulation helping stop rising gas prices could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts. The prompt may not adequately handle such cases where the statement is a political oversimplification rather than a factual error. It should recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false.', 'Example 3 involves a historical fact about the slave trade, which is a well-documented event with reliable historical records. The prompt’s failure to correctly identify this as a true statement suggests it may not prioritize established historical facts over other types of claims. Historical verifications should be a key part of the evaluation process.', 'Example 4 deals with a complex economic claim about corporate tax deductions, which requires a thorough understanding of tax laws and economic policies. The prompt may lack the depth needed to accurately assess such specialized information, leading to incorrect labeling. It should include a mechanism for verifying claims through expert knowledge or detailed research.', 'Examples like 5, 6, 7, and 8 involve statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites. These statements often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation that is common in such settings. The prompt may not adequately account for the typical inaccuracies or exaggerations found in these informal communications, leading to incorrect judgments. It should consider the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt may be too rigid in its approach, potentially overlooking the nuances in political statements where exaggeration or hyperbole is common. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about increasing spending by $12.5 billion might be seen as hyperbolic in a political context, which the model did not account for, leading to a misclassification.', "In Example 2, the statement about medication and abortion might be considered a matter of personal opinion rather than a clear lie, especially in a political debate setting. The model's strict criteria for determining a lie might not accommodate such complex and subjective topics, leading to incorrect classification.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of insufficient context for accurate judgment. Without knowing the specific details of the memo and the actions taken after receiving it, classifying the statement as a lie might be premature. The model needs to better handle situations where there is limited information available.', 'In Example 4, the statement about isolated voter incidents might be seen as a general claim rather than a verifiable fact. Political rhetoric often includes generalizations that may not align with strict factual standards. The model should be more flexible in distinguishing between general claims and verifiable lies.', 'Example 5 showcases the challenge of verifying statements in a timely manner. By the time the statement was made, the relevant data may not yet be available or fully processed. The model should be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely.', 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the context being explicitly labeled with job title, state, party, and other details, which are not always available or accurate. This rigidity can lead to misinterpretation or incorrect classification if some key information is missing or misunderstood.', 'The prompt might not account well for the nuance in language and the complexity of real-world situations. Statements can be misleading without being outright lies, such as in Example 4 where the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context. The prompt needs to consider such subtleties to avoid over-simplifying the task.', "The prompt's criteria for determining a lie do not account for the nuance and complexity of political discourse. In Example 7, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for the elimination of all corporate taxes is likely to be a simplification or exaggeration of his actual stance, but the prompt does not provide guidance on how to recognize and evaluate such simplifications in political rhetoric. This oversight leads to misclassification, as the prompt fails to consider the context and intent behind the statement.", "The prompt's reliance on the context of the statement, such as a fundraising letter or a press release, does not ensure a consistent approach to evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. In Example 8, the statement about the number of countries bombed by different presidents might be a simplified or misleading statistic, but the prompt does not provide a way to verify the accuracy of such claims in the context of a tweet. This lack of specificity in handling different types of contexts can lead to misclassification of statements that are actually truthful but presented in a misleading manner.", 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define what constitutes a "lie" in the context of political statements and personal narratives. Political statements often contain exaggerations and hyperbole that are common rhetorical devices, which the current prompt does not account for adequately. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the American slave trade is factually accurate, but the prompt might not recognize this due to its strict definition of a lie. Similarly, the other examples involve statements that, while potentially exaggerated or misleading, are not necessarily lies in the strict sense intended by the prompt.', "The prompt's reliance on historical and factual background may lead to incorrect classifications if the necessary information is not readily available or if the background knowledge required to verify the statement is not provided. In Examples 3, 4, 5, and 7, the predictions were incorrect because the prompt did not consider the possibility that the statements, although potentially misleading, might be true based on unverified or unknown facts. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the complexity of political discourse.", 'Example 4 involves a statement about a drop-out rate in a congressional district, which is a specific and verifiable statistic. However, the prompt might not have considered the possibility that the statement could be an exaggeration or hyperbole common in political rhetoric. The prediction should take into account the rhetorical style and the likelihood of the claim being an accurate representation of reality, rather than just checking for numerical accuracy.', 'In Example 5, the statement about voting against a bill related to the IRS funding is a factual claim that can be verified through legislative records. The prompt might have missed the nuance that the statement is accurate but might be misleading due to the complexity of the issue. The prediction should consider both the literal truth of the statement and the broader implications of the action taken, rather than just the surface-level accuracy.', "The prompt could also be failing to recognize the nuance in political statements, particularly those made by politicians in a campaign setting. In Example 1, Jeff Merkley's statement about the Democratic National Convention discussing ISIS is a subjective opinion rather than a fact that needs to be directly verified. The prompt's rigid approach to fact-checking may overlook the possibility that such statements are more about perception and rhetoric than verifiable truth.", "In Example 6, the statement about medication in schools is a hyperbolic and potentially inflammatory claim that, while not factually accurate, might be more about the speaker's stance on a controversial issue rather than a straightforward lie. The prompt might need to account for the different types of claims and their implications, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation that considers the speaker's intent and the context of the statement.", "In Example 2, the statement comparing Obama and Bush's bombings is likely a hyperbolic or rhetorical claim rather than a factual assertion that needs to be strictly verified. The prompt should acknowledge that some statements are not meant to be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.", 'For Example 5, the statement about the Social Security system being broke might be a common misperception or a political argument rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt should differentiate between statements that are based on popular misinformation and those that are clearly false according to reliable sources.', 'Lastly, the prompt might struggle with statements that are partially true but exaggerated or misleading. For instance, in Example 5, the statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation. The prompt needs to better account for the intent behind the statement and how it aligns with the facts, rather than just the verifiability of each component.'] items,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context, the reliability of sources, and the accuracy of the information provided. Consider the role and credibility of the speaker, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. Recognize the distinction between absolute and relative statements: an absolute claim must be proven factually correct, whereas a relative claim can be evaluated based on changes over time or context. When evaluating claims made by political figures or public figures, cross-reference the statement with official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure its accuracy. Account for the medium and tone of the communication, considering that informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation. Always assess the reliability of sources and the accuracy of the information provided, taking into account potential misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the credibility of the speaker and the need for absolute factual correctness without properly considering the context and nature of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team is likely false, but the prompt might have overlooked this due to the low credibility of the radio personality as a source of factual information.', "In Example 2, the statement about new taxes on groceries is a relative claim that can be true or false depending on the specific policies proposed, but the prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie due to the advocacy group's job title, which could be biased.", 'Example 3 involves a sensitive and potentially controversial statement from a high-ranking law enforcement official. The prompt might not have correctly assessed the context and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in a campaign setting, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 4 is a straightforward pro-life statement by a U.S. senator, which is typically a clear and direct political stance. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie because it did not recognize the common use of such declarative statements in political discourse.', "Example 5 involves a statement about party switching, which is a factual claim that can be verified through official records. The prompt might have failed to correctly evaluate the statement based on the available context and the nature of the claim itself, instead focusing too much on the speaker's credibility."]

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need for absolute proof from official documents or credible sources, which can be challenging to obtain for statements that are more qualitative or subjective. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about job creation from cap-and-trade legislation is a claim that is difficult to verify with absolute certainty without extensive data analysis and economic modeling, which might not be available or accessible. The prompt's strict adherence to needing factual correctness could lead to misclassification of such claims as lies.", 'In Examples 2 and 7, the statements are more about personal opinions or past actions rather than verifiable facts. The prompt\'s focus on absolute claims and the need to cross-reference with official documents or credible sources might not be appropriate for evaluating statements that are more about the speaker\'s intent or past behavior. Statements like "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill passed" are more about expectations and perceptions, which can be subjective and harder to prove definitively.', "Example 3 is a straightforward claim about political stances, which does not require complex verification but rather a simple comparison of the speaker's positions. The prompt's detailed approach to verifying claims might be too cumbersome for such simple and direct statements, leading to potential misclassifications.", "Examples 4 and 5 involve claims about specific numbers or states' conditions, which can be verified through data and statistics. However, the prompt’s emphasis on the need for absolute proof from official documents or credible sources might overlook the possibility that the statement is generally accurate even if exact data points cannot be verified immediately. This strict requirement for absolute proof could result in the statement being incorrectly labeled as false.", "In Example 6, the statement comparing the number of illegal aliens in different states is likely to be incorrect due to the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data on illegal immigration. The prompt's insistence on needing absolute proof from official documents or credible sources might lead to an incorrect classification if the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven. The statement might be false due to the inaccuracy of the claim, but the process of verification could be challenging."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need for absolute factual correctness, which is challenging to achieve, especially in political contexts where statements can be nuanced and context-dependent. The prompt does not adequately account for the complexity of evaluating statements made by political figures, particularly when those statements involve subjective opinions or contextual interpretations that are difficult to verify with official documents alone.', 'The prompt might have failed to recognize that some statements, even if not factually correct, do not necessarily constitute a lie. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen’s U.S. senate candidacy might be a misstatement but not a lie if it is based on incomplete or outdated information. Similarly, in Example 3, Charlie Crist’s fundraising record might be exaggerated but not entirely false. The prompt needs to distinguish between outright falsehoods and statements that are inaccurate or misleading.', 'The prompt could be too rigid in its approach to verifying statements, leading to incorrect classifications. In Example 4, the statement about the health care law being found constitutional and unconstitutional by courts is likely a simplification or misrepresentation, but it may still reflect the complexity of legal opinions rather than a complete falsehood. The prompt should allow for more nuanced evaluations, recognizing that statements can be partially true or reflect different perspectives without being outright lies.', 'The prompt might not fully appreciate the context and intent behind certain statements, which can affect their classification. In Example 5, the statement about Hillary Clinton winning every time with Donald Trump as her opponent might be an exaggeration or hyperbole used for rhetorical effect, rather than a literal truth. The prompt should consider the medium and tone of communication, allowing for more flexibility in evaluating statements that are meant to persuade rather than strictly inform.', 'The prompt could benefit from a clearer definition of what constitutes a "lie" versus other types of misinformation. In Example 6, the statement about Social Security and Medicare might be a misattribution or misquotation, but it is not necessarily a lie if it reflects a common misunderstanding or a simplified explanation. The prompt needs to distinguish between outright falsehoods and statements that, while inaccurate, may not be intended to deceive.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt might have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the need for absolute factual correctness without considering the context and the nature of the claim. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Florida having more concealed weapons permits than any other state could be considered relative to the context of a Fox News interview, where hyperbole or exaggeration might be common. The prompt does not sufficiently account for the possibility that such statements might be used rhetorically rather than factually.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Governor McAuliffe’s desire to join the Clinton administration’s Cabinet is a relative claim about future intentions, which can be evaluated based on the context of a political figure expressing interest rather than an absolute fact needing immediate verification. The prompt may not have recognized the difference between such relative claims and absolute facts, leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about passing a bipartisan Medicaid bill, which might be a relative claim about legislative achievements rather than an absolute fact. The prompt likely failed to recognize that such claims can be true in the sense that they reflect the outcome of legislative efforts, even if the process was challenging.', 'In Example 4, the statement about deer baiting being illegal in Rhode Island is an absolute claim that requires immediate factual verification. However, the context provided (a commentary in a newspaper) might suggest that the claim is part of a broader discussion rather than a definitive fact. The prompt might not have adequately considered the nuances of different mediums and their typical usage.', 'Example 5 presents a statement about job creation in New Jersey, which is a relative claim about economic trends. The prompt might have incorrectly assumed that the statement needed absolute factual verification, failing to consider that such claims can be true in the context of overall job growth trends, even if they do not represent the peak employment levels.']

Always assess the reliability of sources and the accuracy of the information provided, taking into account potential misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation.

To handle speculative or forward-looking statements, consider the context and the likelihood of the event occurring based on current trends and expert analysis. Statements involving comparisons or projections should be evaluated based on the available data and expert opinions at the time of evaluation.

For claims requiring specialized knowledge, such as those related to tax laws or economic policies, consult relevant experts or conduct comprehensive research to verify the accuracy of the statement. 

When dealing with relative claims, such as legislative achievements or positions among developed countries, evaluate the statement based on the context and the outcome of the relevant processes. Recognize that relative claims can be true in the sense that they reflect the outcome of efforts, even if the process was challenging.

Be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely. Ensure that all necessary data and information are available before making a determination, and consider the possibility that new data may become available after the initial assessment.

Account for the potential for misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation in all communications, and always strive to provide a balanced and accurate evaluation.,

Be mindful of the nuance in language and the complexity of real-world situations; statements can be misleading without being outright lies. For example, the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context. In political statements, consider the possibility of exaggeration or hyperbole. For informal communications, evaluate the typical inaccuracies or exaggerations found in such settings. For straightforward claims about political stances, a simple comparison of the speaker's positions might suffice. Finally, consider whether statements that are technically correct might still be incomplete or potentially misleading, especially when making comparisons across different contexts or countries.,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context, the reliability of sources, and the accuracy of the information provided. Consider the role and credibility of the speaker, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. Recognize the distinction between absolute and relative statements: an absolute claim must be proven factually correct, whereas a relative claim can be evaluated based on changes over time or context. When evaluating claims made by political figures or public figures, cross-reference the statement with official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure its accuracy. Account for the medium and tone of the communication, considering that informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation. Always assess the reliability of sources and the accuracy of the information provided, taking into account potential misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation.

To handle speculative or forward-looking statements, consider the context and the likelihood of the event occurring based on current trends and expert analysis. Statements involving comparisons or projections should be evaluated based on the available data and expert opinions at the time of evaluation.

For claims requiring specialized knowledge, such as those related to tax laws or economic policies, consult relevant experts or conduct comprehensive research to verify the accuracy of the statement. 

When dealing with relative claims, such as legislative achievements or positions among developed countries, evaluate the statement based on the context and the outcome of the relevant processes. Recognize that relative claims can be true in the sense that they reflect the outcome of efforts, even if the process was challenging.

Be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely. Ensure that all necessary data and information are available before making a determination, and consider the possibility that new data may become available after the initial assessment.

Account for the potential for misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation in all communications, and always strive to provide a balanced and accurate evaluation.

Statements in these contexts often reflect opinions, aspirations, or hypothetical scenarios rather than concrete verifiable facts, leading to misclassification when strict factual verification is required.', 'The prompt might also be too rigid in its approach to distinguishing between factual claims and aspirational or speculative statements. In some cases, especially in political contexts, statements might be more about conveying a message or advancing a narrative rather than providing verifiable facts. The prompt needs to account for the possibility that some statements, even if not strictly factual, can be classified as "No" if they are unsupported or contradicted by existing evidence.', 'The prompt’s reliance on "reliable sources" for classification might be too stringent in certain contexts, such as personal experiences or opinions expressed in campaign materials. For instance, a candidate might express a personal belief or intention that, while not verifiable at the moment, should still be considered in the context of the statement itself, rather than being dismissed outright due to lack of supporting data.', "The prompt might not adequately consider the nuances of different job titles and their typical roles. For example, a political figure's statement during a debate or campaign commercial might be more focused on advancing a political agenda rather than providing verifiable facts.

The prompt\'s rigid requirement for evidence might cause it to incorrectly label these as false.', 'The prompt does not adequately account for the context in which statements are made, especially when they are part of political campaigns or media segments. In Examples 2, 4, and 6, the statements are presented in contexts where they might be considered hyperbolic or aspirational rather than strictly factual. The prompt’s criteria for evaluating the truthfulness of statements based solely on verifiable data might lead to incorrect classifications in such scenarios.', 'The prompt’s emphasis on verifying claims through "reliable sources" can be too narrow, failing to recognize the complexity of some statements. For instance, in Example 8, the statement about Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team might be a subjective or aspirational claim rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s standard for "reliable sources" might not encompass the types of data needed to evaluate such claims accurately.', 'The prompt lacks flexibility in handling different types of statements, particularly those that are aspirational or reflect personal experiences. In Example 7, the statement "I\'m pro-life. He\'s not" is a personal opinion and might not require external verification to be classified as true or false. The prompt’s strict criteria for evidence might not be suitable for evaluating such statements, leading to misclassification.', 'The prompt does not sufficiently consider the role of job titles and party affiliations in evaluating the credibility of statements. In Example 4, the context provided by the article from Politico, along with the job title and party affiliation of the speaker, suggests that the statement could be factual.

He’s not” is a clear contrast and does not require extensive fact-checking. The prompt’s emphasis on evidence and data might have led to an incorrect classification, as the statement is a direct comparison rather than a claim needing verification through external sources.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team. This claim can be easily checked against known facts about states and their sports teams, which the prompt does not seem to address adequately. The simplicity of the claim makes it more straightforward to verify, and the prompt’s strict criteria might have led to an incorrect classification.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force is a significant claim that requires immediate verification due to its potential for causing public harm. The prompt’s focus on context and source reliability might have overlooked the urgency and potential for misinformation in such a statement.', 'Example 5 involves a statement from Jeff Greene about going to Cuba, which is more of a personal experience or aspiration rather than a factual claim requiring extensive verification.

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. Additionally, distinguish between factual statements and opinions. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, and should be evaluated based on their verifiability. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly.

The prompt’s emphasis on official documents or credible sources might cause it to miss this true statement.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies, which, while exaggerated, could still be true based on scientific evidence. The prompt’s focus on factual accuracy and reliable sources might overlook the validity of such a claim, leading to a false negative.', 'For Example 4, the statement about Senator Webb being reliable for Obama and Reid could be true based on observed voting patterns or other evidence, but the prompt’s prioritization of verifiable facts might result in a false negative.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage could be true based on the senator’s past votes or public record, but the prompt’s requirement for clear political party alignment might cause it to be labeled incorrectly.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt might have gotten these examples wrong because it overly emphasizes the need for verifying statements against official documents or credible sources, which can sometimes lead to missing the context or nuance of the statement. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about job creation from cap-and-trade legislation might be a forward-looking claim intended to influence policy rather than a strictly factual assertion, which the prompt might not account for adequately.', 'In the case of Example 2, the statement about campaign contributions might reflect a broader narrative or strategy rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s focus on factual accuracy might cause it to miss the political context and the intent behind the statement, leading to an incorrect label.', "Example 3 highlights the issue of incomplete information. Without specific details about Joni Ernst's promises, the prompt might struggle to determine the veracity of the statement, especially if the promise is a common political rhetoric or a vague campaign pledge that is difficult to verify.", 'Example 4 involves a factual claim about concealed weapons permits. The prompt might prioritize checking against real data but fail to recognize that such claims can be true even if not widely known or reported, especially in specific states like Florida.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage is likely a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s emphasis on factual accuracy might not align well with evaluating statements about personal beliefs or opinions, which can vary widely and are less amenable to verification through official documents.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt might be getting these examples wrong because it places too much emphasis on verifying statements against official documents or credible sources, which can sometimes be impractical or unnecessary for certain types of statements. For instance, in political and economic contexts, statements made during campaigns often reflect intentions and rhetoric rather than strict factual accuracy, and should be evaluated within that framework rather than solely based on verifiability against specific documents.', "Another reason could be that the prompt does not adequately account for the context in which statements are made. For example, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen’s U.S. senate candidacy is a job description and role clarification, which is generally considered accurate unless there's evidence to the contrary. Similarly, in Example 4, the statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies is a factual claim that can be easily verified against scientific literature, and the prediction should align with the actual verifiability of the claim.", 'The prompt also seems to prioritize official documents and credible sources over the inherent nature of the statement itself. In Example 2, the statement about Kurt Schrader casting a deciding vote is a direct claim that can be checked against legislative records, and the prediction should be based on whether such records exist and confirm the statement. The same applies to Example 5, where the statement about John McCain’s speech can be cross-checked against transcripts or media reports from the Democratic National Convention.', 'The prompt might be overly rigid in its approach, failing to recognize the nuance in political and economic contexts. For instance, in Example 6, the statement about Sharron Angle’s campaign promise to eliminate the Department of Education is a policy intention rather than a verifiable fact. Political candidates often make promises and proposals without immediate verifiability, and the prediction should focus more on the plausibility and context of the statement rather than its strict verifiability.', "Lastly, the prompt does not sufficiently consider the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in campaign settings. In Examples 7 and 8, the statements are made during speeches or debates, where speakers often use rhetoric and hyperbole to make their points. The prediction should account for the speaker’s role and the nature of the event (e.g., a political convention or a debate), rather than strictly evaluating the statement's verifiability."]

This oversight led to incorrect predictions in Examples 1, 4, and 6, where the statements were likely part of a broader narrative or argument.', 'The prompt does not clearly distinguish between different types of statements that may require different levels of scrutiny.

Consider the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in political and economic contexts, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. Account for the political and economic contexts, recognizing that statements made during campaigns may reflect political rhetoric and intentions rather than strict factual accuracy. Prioritize checking against real data or reliable sources for factual claims, and evaluate the reliability of sources, including those from politicians or public figures who may provide inaccurate or misleading information due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation. 

Additionally, assess whether the statement is technically correct but potentially misleading due to incomplete information or context. For example, statements about minimum wages being low compared to other countries should consider the overall economic context and living standards. 

Differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations. If a candidate has not officially stated their positions, avoid classifying statements about these positions as lies unless there is clear evidence of disconnection from official records. 

Recognize the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. Some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized. For instance, a statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level but not necessarily when considered nationally. 

Evaluate relative claims about future intentions or economic trends based on the context provided. Claims about a political figure's future actions, such as expressing interest in joining a Cabinet, should be evaluated based on the context of the statement rather than immediate factual verification. Similarly, claims about economic trends, such as job creation in a state, should be evaluated in the context of overall trends rather than requiring absolute factual verification. 

Account for the possibility that some statements can be true in a specific context but not when generalized or applied to a broader scope.,

Prioritize checking against real data or reliable sources for factual claims, and evaluate the reliability of sources, including those from politicians or public figures who may provide inaccurate or misleading information due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation.

When evaluating statements that involve comparisons or projections, consider the available data and expert opinions, and be cautious of speculative or forward-looking claims. For statements that cannot be directly verified, assess their plausibility and consistency with known facts. In political and economic contexts, recognize the potential for exaggeration and hyperbole, and consider the speaker's motives and the historical record.

For financial claims, consider the reliability of the source, even if it is not an official document. If the source is a newsletter or other non-official document, cross-reference with more reliable sources to ensure accuracy. Be aware that statements made in political contexts may reflect rhetoric rather than strict factual accuracy, and prioritize checking against real data or reliable sources for factual claims.

Account for the nuances in political statements, including the possibility of exaggeration or hyperbole, and use your judgment to determine the likelihood of the statement being true. If the statement involves a relative position among developed countries or similar comparisons, evaluate it based on available data and expert analysis.

By considering these factors, you will be better equipped to accurately assess the truthfulness of the statements provided.,

The model should consider the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in political and economic contexts, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. Recognize the political and economic contexts, understanding that statements made during campaigns may reflect political rhetoric and intentions rather than strict factual accuracy. Prioritize checking against real data or reliable sources for factual claims, and evaluate the reliability of sources, including those from politicians or public figures who may provide inaccurate or misleading information due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation.

Additionally, the model should distinguish between factual claims and personal narratives. Personal beliefs or opinions expressed in interviews should not be treated as verifiable facts unless supported by concrete evidence. For specialized information, such as economic claims or legal facts, the model should incorporate mechanisms for verifying claims through expert knowledge or detailed research. This includes understanding the nuances of tax laws, economic policies, and other specialized fields.

Context and specific details provided in each example are crucial. The model should interpret the relationship between the statement and the given context carefully. For instance, a statement about a news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, and the model should not overlook such contextual nuances.

Statements can sometimes be misleading without being outright lies. Terms like "flip-flopping" are often used politically to suggest change without providing context. The model should consider such subtleties to avoid over-simplifying the task. Verify claims using real data or reliable sources, and be aware that certain claims can be true even if not widely known or reported, especially in specific regions or states.

The model should also handle personal beliefs or opinions differently from factual claims. In interviews, statements should be evaluated based on their alignment with verifiable facts or the speaker’s known positions, rather than taking them at face value.

By incorporating these considerations, the model will be better equipped to accurately predict the truthfulness of statements in various contexts.,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context, the reliability of sources, and the accuracy of the information provided. Consider the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in political and economic contexts, and verify statements against official documents or credible sources when necessary. Account for the political and economic contexts, recognizing that statements made during campaigns may reflect political rhetoric and intentions rather than strict factual accuracy. Prioritize checking against real data or reliable sources for factual claims, and evaluate the reliability of sources, including those from politicians or public figures who may provide inaccurate or misleading information due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation. 

Additionally, assess whether the statement is technically correct but potentially misleading due to incomplete information or context. For example, statements about minimum wages being low compared to other countries should consider the overall economic context and living standards. 

Differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations. If a candidate has not officially stated their positions, avoid classifying statements about these positions as lies unless there is clear evidence of disconnection from official records. 

Recognize the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. Some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized. For instance, a statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level but not necessarily when considered nationally. 

Evaluate relative claims about future intentions or economic trends based on the context provided. Claims about a political figure's future actions, such as expressing interest in joining a Cabinet, should be evaluated based on the context of the statement rather than immediate factual verification. Similarly, claims about economic trends, such as job creation in a state, should be evaluated in the context of overall trends rather than requiring absolute factual verification. 

Account for the possibility that some statements can be true in a specific context but not when generalized or applied to a broader scope.

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole.

The prompt should account for the persuasive nature of such contexts. Similarly, in Example 4, the statement is from an interview on Fox News, a conservative outlet known for its specific editorial stance, which might influence the framing of the statement. The prompt needs to acknowledge that political statements can be presented in a way that aligns with the speaker’s narrative without necessarily being factually accurate.', 'The prompt’s reliance on official sources and data might not adequately address statements made by individuals who do not have official platforms or verifiable records. In Example 3, the statement is from a former governor discussing their actions and endorsements, which are personal experiences and positions rather than verifiable facts. The prompt should differentiate between factual claims and personal opinions, especially when dealing with political figures.', 'The prompt’s strict criteria for classifying statements based on supporting evidence might not work well for statements that are based on subjective experiences or perspectives, such as those in Example 5. The statement about Mitt Romney’s position on the NRA is a matter of opinion rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt should allow for some flexibility in evaluating statements that are inherently subjective or based on personal beliefs.', 'In Examples 6 through 8, the statements are from campaign contexts or informal communications, such as emails and debates. These contexts often include exaggerations or hyperbole that are common in political rhetoric. The prompt should recognize that such statements are typically evaluated based on their intent and the context of the communication rather than strict factual accuracy. This would help in correctly classifying these types of statements.', 'The prompt’s focus on verifying statements against reliable sources might overlook the nuance of political discourse, where statements are often made in a broader context that includes ideological framing. For example, in Example 1, the statement about tax contributions by the top 1 percent is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of tax policy and economic data. The prompt should include guidance on how to interpret such statements within the broader context of political and economic discussions.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define how to handle statements that are based on subjective opinions or personal beliefs, especially in the context of political figures or public figures. For instance, in Example 6, the statement reflects a personal opinion about amnesty, which might be considered subjective and less verifiable through factual data alone. The prompt should clarify that personal opinions or stances on policy issues can be classified as "Yes" if they are not supported by concrete evidence or if they present a misleading view of reality.', 'The prompt might also be too focused on the need for supporting evidence from reliable sources, which can sometimes be absent in statements made during debates or speeches, where the primary goal is to persuade rather than to provide verifiable facts. In Example 4, the statement about the percentage of Hispanic babies born in Oregon is likely based on data that is not provided in the context, and the prompt may not sufficiently account for the intent and context of such statements, leading to an incorrect classification.', "The prompt's criteria for evaluating statements might be overly rigid, leading to misclassifications when dealing with nuanced or complex topics. In Example 2, the statement about biking in a crosswalk is based on a legal requirement that might not be explicitly stated but is part of the broader legal framework. The prompt should consider the possibility that some statements might be true even if specific data is not provided, particularly in contexts like legal regulations or common knowledge.", 'The prompt may lack a clear distinction between factual claims and speculative statements, which can lead to misclassification. In Example 3, the statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies is a scientific claim that requires specific data to support it. However, the prompt might not adequately address the complexity of such claims, potentially leading to an incorrect classification if the statement is not immediately refuted by known data.', "The prompt's evaluation of statements made by public figures, especially in campaign settings, might be too focused on the reliability of the source rather than the context and intent of the statement. In Example 7, the statement about eliminating the Department of Education in a campaign commercial is a political stance that might not be backed by concrete data but is intended to influence voters' perceptions.

This suggests that the prompt might not be flexible enough to recognize political rhetoric and the nature of political figures' statements, which often involve nuanced positions rather than strict factual claims.", 'In Example 2, the statement about the health care law being found both constitutional and unconstitutional by different courts is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on legal precedents and official rulings. However, the model incorrectly labeled it as false, indicating that the prompt might not effectively distinguish between claims based on legal facts and those that could be subject to interpretation or multiple outcomes.', 'Example 3 highlights a situation where the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud is a specific claim that needs to be verified against accurate data. The model’s incorrect classification suggests that the prompt may not handle specialized areas like criminal statistics with the necessary granularity, potentially overlooking the need for detailed data analysis.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Charlie Crist breaking a record for fundraising is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on historical data. The model’s incorrect classification points to a lack of robust mechanisms within the prompt to cross-reference claims with verifiable records, especially when dealing with financial achievements that can be objectively measured.', 'Example 5 involves a comparative claim about the number of illegal aliens in Georgia versus Arizona, which requires precise demographic data to verify.

In some cases, the examples provided do not have clear supporting data, leading to misclassification.', "The prompt might also be too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the nuances of different contexts, such as political rhetoric or personal opinions.

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.

In evaluating the statement, consider the macro-level and micro-level truths. A statement might be true in a specific context but not when generalized to a broader scope. For instance, if a statement claims a state leads in a particular statistic, verify if this holds true when compared to national or international data.

Prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone. For example, a statement from a retired police captain about law-enforcement officers dying earlier than the general population might be based on extensive experience and therefore accurate, even if not widely documented in official records.

Be mindful of the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. Statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation. Consider these elements when assessing the veracity of the claim.

For personal experiences or aspirations, such as a high-ranking law enforcement official discussing a personal goal like visiting Cuba, evaluate them based on the nature of the statement rather than requiring extensive external verification. Personal remarks and aspirations do not necessarily require the same level of factual substantiation as formal claims.

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. Contextualize the statement within its intended purpose and audience.,

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. 

When dealing with personal opinions, past actions, or statements that are more about the speaker's intent or past behavior, consider the broader context and the likelihood of the statement being true based on the available information. For statements referring to historical facts, evaluate them based on the best available evidence at the time of the statement, even if they are not strictly verifiable through ongoing data. For formal addresses or speeches, such as those given during major policy announcements, consider the content as a policy stance rather than a personal opinion unless explicitly stated otherwise. In cases where there is limited information or insufficient context, avoid making definitive judgments and classify the statement based on the available evidence.

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that complex claims may involve historical data or specific events that can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, rather than just verifiable data. When in doubt, classify the statement based on the most credible and relevant information available.,

When dealing with relative claims, such as economic trends or job creation, consider the overall context and trends rather than expecting absolute factual verification. Ensure that the evaluation takes into account the potential for exaggeration, hyperbole, and the specific context in which the statement was made.,

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole.

When evaluating statements, differentiate clearly between factual claims and recommendations or calls to action. Recommendations or calls to action, even if based on factual premises, should be classified as "No" if they are not directly supported by evidence or if they are misleading.

Relative claims about economic trends or other metrics should be evaluated in the context of broader trends and data. Do not assume that a statement needs absolute factual verification; instead, consider whether the claim aligns with general trends or patterns.

Context is crucial but should be complemented by cross-referencing with multiple reliable sources. If the context provided does not include sufficient information to verify the claim, do not rely solely on the given context. Instead, seek additional information from credible sources.

Be mindful of the time lag in verifying claims, especially in rapidly changing situations. Avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely when the necessary data or information is not yet available or fully processed.,

  prompt: # Task
Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.

In evaluating the statement, consider the macro-level and micro-level truths. A statement might be true in a specific context but not when generalized to a broader scope. For instance, if a statement claims a state leads in a particular statistic, verify if this holds true when compared to national or international data.

Prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone. For example, a statement from a retired police captain about law-enforcement officers dying earlier than the general population might be based on extensive experience and therefore accurate, even if not widely documented in official records.

Be mindful of the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. Statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation. Consider these elements when assessing the veracity of the claim.

For personal experiences or aspirations, such as a high-ranking law enforcement official discussing a personal goal like visiting Cuba, evaluate them based on the nature of the statement rather than requiring extensive external verification. Personal remarks and aspirations do not necessarily require the same level of factual substantiation as formal claims.

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but be aware that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. Contextualize the statement within its intended purpose and audience.

  feedbacks: ['The prompt may be too simplistic, expecting a binary "lie" or "not a lie" without considering the nuances of the context, job title, and party affiliation. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about New Jersey\'s tenure law reform could be factually correct but the prediction being "No" suggests the model didn\'t account for the speaker\'s role as the Governor, who would have direct influence over such reforms.', 'In Example 1, the model might not have correctly interpreted the context as an opinion piece, leading it to incorrectly label the statement as false. Opinion pieces often contain subjective views rather than verifiable facts, which the model might not recognize.', 'Example 2 highlights that the model might be overly literal and miss the intended meaning. The statement reflects personal experience rather than a factual claim, which the model could interpret as a lie due to its lack of verifiability.', 'For Example 4, the model might not have considered the context of political debates where statements are often hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The model may need to understand that such statements are common in political rhetoric and should not always be taken at face value.', 'In Example 5, the model might have struggled with the context of an interview, where statements can be based on personal beliefs or opinions rather than verifiable facts. The model needs to better distinguish between factual claims and personal narratives.', 'The prompt may be failing because it does not adequately consider the context and specific details provided in each example. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, but the prompt\'s generic approach might lead to the incorrect prediction of "No". The model needs to be more nuanced in how it interprets the relationship between the statement and the given context.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity in the job titles and roles. In Example 4, the Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws would likely be accurate, especially if the context is a speech at a reputable institution. The model might need better training to recognize the credibility of statements based on the speaker’s position and the context.', 'The prompt might also be failing due to insufficient understanding of political and economic contexts. In Example 5, the statement about Medicare passing with little Republican support could be true based on historical facts, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to determine this accurately without additional context or training.', 'In Examples 6 and 8, the model might be struggling with identifying factual statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. For Example 6, the governor discussing income taxes in Ohio compared to Texas and Oklahoma might be accurate based on known policies, but the model’s generic approach might lead to a false negative.', "Lastly, the model might be overgeneralizing the accuracy of statements made by public figures, regardless of the context. In Example 7, the statement about the deficit being largely due to past policies and the recession could be true, but the model might not account for the complexities of economic policy or the speaker's credibility well enough.", 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in defining what constitutes a lie. It does not clearly outline the criteria for determining if a statement is false based on the context, job title, party affiliation, or the source of the statement. This ambiguity leads to inconsistent interpretations and incorrect predictions.', 'The prompt does not account for the reliability of sources or the accuracy of information provided. For instance, statements made by politicians or public figures may contain inaccuracies due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation, which the current prompt does not consider.', 'The prompt fails to address the temporal aspect of the information. Statements made in the past might be true at the time but become false later due to changes in circumstances. Without considering the current status or recent developments, the classifier may incorrectly label statements as lies.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between opinions and factual statements. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, leading to misclassification. The classifier needs to distinguish between statements that are verifiable facts versus subjective opinions.', 'The prompt does not provide guidelines on how to handle conflicting information or multiple pieces of evidence. In cases where there is contradictory information, the classifier should weigh the evidence before making a determination, rather than relying solely on the given context.', 'In Example 2, the statement comparing hunting and fishing license holders to voters might be a lie if the actual data shows a different ratio. The classifier needs to check against real data or reliable sources to determine the veracity of such claims, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', "Example 3 involves a statement about a right-wing group's spending in the primary election. This might be a lie if the group did not spend as much as claimed. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify claims against known financial records or statements from the relevant parties.", "For Example 4, the statement about Danny Tarkanian's positions on Planned Parenthood and abortion rights might be misleading if the candidate has not officially stated these positions. The classifier needs to differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations.", 'In Example 5, the statement about the Democratic National Convention’s lack of mentions on ISIS might be a lie if the convention did indeed discuss the topic. The classifier should be instructed to cross-check against official transcripts or reports from the event to ensure the statement aligns with the actual content.', "The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the credibility of the speaker or the source of the information. In Example 1, the speaker is a Democrat in a debate, which might influence the statement's accuracy. The prompt should consider the speaker's role and party affiliation, especially in political contexts, to better assess the reliability of the claim.", 'The context provided in some examples, such as Example 6, might not always include enough information to verify the claim. The prompt should emphasize the importance of cross-referencing the statement with multiple reliable sources, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', 'The prompt focuses too much on whether the statement is supported by data or contradicts available data, but it does not adequately address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements. Examples like Example 4, where the statement mentions a future event, might be more about aspiration rather than a factual claim, and thus should not necessarily be labeled as false without additional context.', 'The prompt fails to acknowledge the distinction between absolute and relative statements. In Example 8, while the statement about the five Democratic state senators might be factually incorrect, it could still be a true relative statement if the number of senators in favor or against the bill has changed over time. The prompt should clarify how to handle relative claims versus absolute claims.', "The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly focuses on the reliability of the claim being supported by real data or official records, which can be subjective and varies greatly depending on the topic. In some cases, the statement might be a common belief or a specific claim within a certain context that doesn't necessarily need to be backed by official records to be considered accurate. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about having more children's hospitals might be a well-known fact within Ohio, even if it isn't widely reported in national data. The prompt needs to account for such contextual and local truths.", "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to handle complex claims that involve historical data or specific events. In Example 4, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes might be true based on historical actions or statements, even if it hasn't been officially recorded. The prompt needs to consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, rather than just verifiable data.", "The prompt might not adequately address the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. In Example 5, the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level, even if it doesn't hold up when aggregated nationally. The prompt should recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.", "The prompt may be too focused on the source of the information rather than the accuracy and context of the statement itself. In Example 7, the retired police captain's statement about law-enforcement officers dying 10 years earlier than the general population might be based on his extensive experience, making it a true statement despite not being widely documented in official records. The prompt should prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone.", 'The prompt\'s definition of "real data" and "official records" might be too narrow, leading to misclassification. In Example 1, while Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team may seem subjective, it could still be considered a factual claim if supported by recent census data or sports league records, which the prompt does not explicitly consider reliable.', 'The prompt’s approach to verifying claims through reliable sources might be inconsistent or overly strict. In Example 2, the prediction "Yes" suggests a lack of verification from official sources like government reports or health care spending data, which might be necessary for accurate classification.', 'The prompt’s treatment of political statements and campaign rhetoric might be overly skeptical. In Example 7, the statement about eliminating the Department of Education in a campaign commercial should be classified based on the political context rather than its factual verifiability, which the prompt did not account for.', 'In Example 2, the statement about economic and social mobility is from a fundraising letter, which is typically aimed at soliciting donations rather than providing accurate statistical data. The prompt\'s focus on "official records" might lead it to overlook the nature of the source and incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a subjective claim meant to evoke a response rather than present verifiable facts.', 'Example 3 involves a campaign commercial, which is known for presenting claims that may not be fully substantiated. The prompt\'s criteria for classifying statements as true or false based on "evidence or official records" may not apply well to campaign advertisements, where the goal is often to persuade rather than provide accurate information. This can result in misclassification of the statement as false.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Congressman Nye voting against a bill is from his own website, which is a primary source for his actions and positions. However, the prompt might be too rigid in its requirement for "official records," leading it to miss the fact that Congressman Nye himself is the most authoritative source for his voting record, thus incorrectly labeling the statement as false.', 'Example 5 involves a statement made during a major foreign policy speech, which is a formal and public address. While the statement is attributed to a future President-Elect, the context suggests it is a policy position rather than a personal opinion. The prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations might lead it to incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a policy stance.', 'The prompt might be too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the complexity of political contexts where statements can be true but misleading depending on the audience or the issue at hand. For instance, statements about healthcare reform can be accurate even if some aspects of the implementation are controversial or misunderstood.', 'The prompt could be missing guidance on how to handle statements that are technically correct but incomplete or potentially misleading. For example, statements about minimum wages being low compared to other countries might be true, but the comparison should consider the overall economic context and living standards.', "The prompt does not specify how to handle statements from politicians who have changed their positions over time. It should include a consideration of the speaker's evolving stance and how that affects the truthfulness of their current statement.", 'The prompt lacks a clear method for verifying claims made by political figures, especially when those claims are part of a broader narrative or campaign. It should include instructions on cross-referencing claims with official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure the accuracy of the statement.', 'Lastly, the prompt does not address how to handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking. Examples like Example 5, where the statement claims a relative position among developed countries, require a different approach compared to statements that can be directly verified with current data. The prompt should include instructions on how to evaluate such statements, especially when they involve comparisons or projections.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Jews receiving notices in Ukraine is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently consider the historical context and the verifiability of such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Obama and Bush bombing countries is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not properly weigh the credibility of the source or the historical accuracy of the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 5 discusses campaign contributions from electric utilities, which is a factual claim that should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently prioritize the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in a political setting, which could result in an incorrect prediction.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the nature and context of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the claim about cancer deaths being higher than 3,000 daily in the U.S. is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of statistics, but the statement is not inherently false without evidence. The prompt might be too quick to label such claims as lies without proper verification. It should encourage more nuanced evaluation rather than a binary yes/no decision.', 'In Example 2, the statement about halting EPA regulation helping stop rising gas prices could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts. The prompt may not adequately handle such cases where the statement is a political oversimplification rather than a factual error. It should recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false.', 'Example 3 involves a historical fact about the slave trade, which is a well-documented event with reliable historical records. The prompt’s failure to correctly identify this as a true statement suggests it may not prioritize established historical facts over other types of claims. Historical verifications should be a key part of the evaluation process.', 'Example 4 deals with a complex economic claim about corporate tax deductions, which requires a thorough understanding of tax laws and economic policies. The prompt may lack the depth needed to accurately assess such specialized information, leading to incorrect labeling. It should include a mechanism for verifying claims through expert knowledge or detailed research.', 'Examples like 5, 6, 7, and 8 involve statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites. These statements often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation that is common in such settings. The prompt may not adequately account for the typical inaccuracies or exaggerations found in these informal communications, leading to incorrect judgments. It should consider the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt may be too rigid in its approach, potentially overlooking the nuances in political statements where exaggeration or hyperbole is common. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about increasing spending by $12.5 billion might be seen as hyperbolic in a political context, which the model did not account for, leading to a misclassification.', "In Example 2, the statement about medication and abortion might be considered a matter of personal opinion rather than a clear lie, especially in a political debate setting. The model's strict criteria for determining a lie might not accommodate such complex and subjective topics, leading to incorrect classification.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of insufficient context for accurate judgment. Without knowing the specific details of the memo and the actions taken after receiving it, classifying the statement as a lie might be premature. The model needs to better handle situations where there is limited information available.', 'In Example 4, the statement about isolated voter incidents might be seen as a general claim rather than a verifiable fact. Political rhetoric often includes generalizations that may not align with strict factual standards. The model should be more flexible in distinguishing between general claims and verifiable lies.', 'Example 5 showcases the challenge of verifying statements in a timely manner. By the time the statement was made, the relevant data may not yet be available or fully processed. The model should be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely.', 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the context being explicitly labeled with job title, state, party, and other details, which are not always available or accurate. This rigidity can lead to misinterpretation or incorrect classification if some key information is missing or misunderstood.', 'The prompt might not account well for the nuance in language and the complexity of real-world situations. Statements can be misleading without being outright lies, such as in Example 4 where the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context. The prompt needs to consider such subtleties to avoid over-simplifying the task.', "The prompt's criteria for determining a lie do not account for the nuance and complexity of political discourse. In Example 7, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for the elimination of all corporate taxes is likely to be a simplification or exaggeration of his actual stance, but the prompt does not provide guidance on how to recognize and evaluate such simplifications in political rhetoric. This oversight leads to misclassification, as the prompt fails to consider the context and intent behind the statement.", "The prompt's reliance on the context of the statement, such as a fundraising letter or a press release, does not ensure a consistent approach to evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. In Example 8, the statement about the number of countries bombed by different presidents might be a simplified or misleading statistic, but the prompt does not provide a way to verify the accuracy of such claims in the context of a tweet. This lack of specificity in handling different types of contexts can lead to misclassification of statements that are actually truthful but presented in a misleading manner.", 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define what constitutes a "lie" in the context of political statements and personal narratives. Political statements often contain exaggerations and hyperbole that are common rhetorical devices, which the current prompt does not account for adequately. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the American slave trade is factually accurate, but the prompt might not recognize this due to its strict definition of a lie. Similarly, the other examples involve statements that, while potentially exaggerated or misleading, are not necessarily lies in the strict sense intended by the prompt.', "The prompt's reliance on historical and factual background may lead to incorrect classifications if the necessary information is not readily available or if the background knowledge required to verify the statement is not provided. In Examples 3, 4, 5, and 7, the predictions were incorrect because the prompt did not consider the possibility that the statements, although potentially misleading, might be true based on unverified or unknown facts. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the complexity of political discourse.", 'Example 4 involves a statement about a drop-out rate in a congressional district, which is a specific and verifiable statistic. However, the prompt might not have considered the possibility that the statement could be an exaggeration or hyperbole common in political rhetoric. The prediction should take into account the rhetorical style and the likelihood of the claim being an accurate representation of reality, rather than just checking for numerical accuracy.', 'In Example 5, the statement about voting against a bill related to the IRS funding is a factual claim that can be verified through legislative records. The prompt might have missed the nuance that the statement is accurate but might be misleading due to the complexity of the issue. The prediction should consider both the literal truth of the statement and the broader implications of the action taken, rather than just the surface-level accuracy.', "The prompt could also be failing to recognize the nuance in political statements, particularly those made by politicians in a campaign setting. In Example 1, Jeff Merkley's statement about the Democratic National Convention discussing ISIS is a subjective opinion rather than a fact that needs to be directly verified. The prompt's rigid approach to fact-checking may overlook the possibility that such statements are more about perception and rhetoric than verifiable truth.", "In Example 6, the statement about medication in schools is a hyperbolic and potentially inflammatory claim that, while not factually accurate, might be more about the speaker's stance on a controversial issue rather than a straightforward lie. The prompt might need to account for the different types of claims and their implications, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation that considers the speaker's intent and the context of the statement.", "In Example 2, the statement comparing Obama and Bush's bombings is likely a hyperbolic or rhetorical claim rather than a factual assertion that needs to be strictly verified. The prompt should acknowledge that some statements are not meant to be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.", 'For Example 5, the statement about the Social Security system being broke might be a common misperception or a political argument rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt should differentiate between statements that are based on popular misinformation and those that are clearly false according to reliable sources.', 'Lastly, the prompt might struggle with statements that are partially true but exaggerated or misleading. For instance, in Example 5, the statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation. The prompt needs to better account for the intent behind the statement and how it aligns with the facts, rather than just the verifiability of each component.', "In Example 2, the statement about new taxes on groceries is a relative claim that can be true or false depending on the specific policies proposed, but the prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie due to the advocacy group's job title, which could be biased.", 'Example 3 involves a sensitive and potentially controversial statement from a high-ranking law enforcement official. The prompt might not have correctly assessed the context and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in a campaign setting, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 4 is a straightforward pro-life statement by a U.S. senator, which is typically a clear and direct political stance. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie because it did not recognize the common use of such declarative statements in political discourse.', 'In Examples 2 and 7, the statements are more about personal opinions or past actions rather than verifiable facts. The prompt\'s focus on absolute claims and the need to cross-reference with official documents or credible sources might not be appropriate for evaluating statements that are more about the speaker\'s intent or past behavior. Statements like "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill passed" are more about expectations and perceptions, which can be subjective and harder to prove definitively.', "Example 3 is a straightforward claim about political stances, which does not require complex verification but rather a simple comparison of the speaker's positions. The prompt's detailed approach to verifying claims might be too cumbersome for such simple and direct statements, leading to potential misclassifications.", "In Example 6, the statement comparing the number of illegal aliens in different states is likely to be incorrect due to the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data on illegal immigration. The prompt's insistence on needing absolute proof from official documents or credible sources might lead to an incorrect classification if the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven. The statement might be false due to the inaccuracy of the claim, but the process of verification could be challenging.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Governor McAuliffe’s desire to join the Clinton administration’s Cabinet is a relative claim about future intentions, which can be evaluated based on the context of a political figure expressing interest rather than an absolute fact needing immediate verification. The prompt may not have recognized the difference between such relative claims and absolute facts, leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about passing a bipartisan Medicaid bill, which might be a relative claim about legislative achievements rather than an absolute fact. The prompt likely failed to recognize that such claims can be true in the sense that they reflect the outcome of legislative efforts, even if the process was challenging.', 'In Example 4, the statement about deer baiting being illegal in Rhode Island is an absolute claim that requires immediate factual verification. However, the context provided (a commentary in a newspaper) might suggest that the claim is part of a broader discussion rather than a definitive fact. The prompt might not have adequately considered the nuances of different mediums and their typical usage.', 'Example 5 presents a statement about job creation in New Jersey, which is a relative claim about economic trends. The prompt might have incorrectly assumed that the statement needed absolute factual verification, failing to consider that such claims can be true in the context of overall job growth trends, even if they do not represent the peak employment levels.', 'The prompt’s reliance on "reliable sources" for classification might be too stringent in certain contexts, such as personal experiences or opinions expressed in campaign materials. For instance, a candidate might express a personal belief or intention that, while not verifiable at the moment, should still be considered in the context of the statement itself, rather than being dismissed outright due to lack of supporting data.', 'The prompt might not effectively distinguish between historical facts and current assertions. In cases like Example 1, where the statement refers to a historical fact (more people working in New Jersey), the prompt might overlook the potential for accurate historical claims that do not require ongoing verification through current data. The classification should take into account the nature of the statement and the time frame it pertains to.', 'The prompt lacks flexibility in handling different types of statements, particularly those that are aspirational or reflect personal experiences. In Example 7, the statement "I\'m pro-life. He\'s not" is a personal opinion and might not require external verification to be classified as true or false. The prompt’s strict criteria for evidence might not be suitable for evaluating such statements, leading to misclassification.', 'The prompt may have been too rigid in its approach to evaluating statements, leading to misclassification. It emphasizes verifying claims against official records and reliable sources but does not sufficiently account for the nature of the claim itself. For example, in Example 1, the statement about Joni Ernst’s promise to shut down government agencies is likely to be false or exaggerated, but the prompt’s focus on official records might not capture the hyperbolic nature of the claim effectively.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force is a significant claim that requires immediate verification due to its potential for causing public harm. The prompt’s focus on context and source reliability might have overlooked the urgency and potential for misinformation in such a statement.', 'Example 5 involves a statement from Jeff Greene about going to Cuba, which is more of a personal experience or aspiration rather than a factual claim requiring extensive verification. The prompt’s emphasis on factual claims and reliance on external sources might have led to an incorrect classification, overlooking the nature of the statement as a personal remark.', 'The prompt might not adequately distinguish between aspirational statements and factual claims. In Example 7, the statement about Governor McAuliffe wanting a Cabinet position is an aspirational statement rather than a factual claim. The prompt\'s focus on "verified by reliable sources" and "supported by real data" may not apply to such aspirational statements, leading to incorrect classification.', "The prompt might be incorrectly evaluating the examples because it overly relies on the need for verifiable facts and official documents, which can lead to false negatives for statements that are true but not easily verifiable. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Kurt Schrader's vote could be true despite the lack of immediate access to official records, as the context suggests a plausible scenario given his position and the issue at hand.", 'In Example 2, the financial claim about the U.S. borrowing ratio might be accurate according to available data, even though the source is an email newsletter. The prompt’s emphasis on official documents or credible sources might cause it to miss this true statement.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies, which, while exaggerated, could still be true based on scientific evidence. The prompt’s focus on factual accuracy and reliable sources might overlook the validity of such a claim, leading to a false negative.', 'For Example 4, the statement about Senator Webb being reliable for Obama and Reid could be true based on observed voting patterns or other evidence, but the prompt’s prioritization of verifiable facts might result in a false negative.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage could be true based on the senator’s past votes or public record, but the prompt’s requirement for clear political party alignment might cause it to be labeled incorrectly.', "Example 3 highlights the issue of incomplete information. Without specific details about Joni Ernst's promises, the prompt might struggle to determine the veracity of the statement, especially if the promise is a common political rhetoric or a vague campaign pledge that is difficult to verify.", 'Example 4 involves a factual claim about concealed weapons permits. The prompt might prioritize checking against real data but fail to recognize that such claims can be true even if not widely known or reported, especially in specific states like Florida.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage is likely a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s emphasis on factual accuracy might not align well with evaluating statements about personal beliefs or opinions, which can vary widely and are less amenable to verification through official documents.', "Another reason could be that the prompt does not adequately account for the context in which statements are made. For example, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen’s U.S. senate candidacy is a job description and role clarification, which is generally considered accurate unless there's evidence to the contrary. Similarly, in Example 4, the statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies is a factual claim that can be easily verified against scientific literature, and the prediction should align with the actual verifiability of the claim.", 'The prompt lacks specific guidance on how to handle statements that are supported by multiple conflicting sources, as seen in Example 6. In such cases, the process of determining the truthfulness of the statement becomes more complex and requires a nuanced approach, which the current prompt does not adequately address.', 'The prompt’s focus on verifying statements against reliable sources might overlook the nuance of political discourse, where statements are often made in a broader context that includes ideological framing. For example, in Example 1, the statement about tax contributions by the top 1 percent is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of tax policy and economic data. The prompt should include guidance on how to interpret such statements within the broader context of political and economic discussions.', "The prompt's criteria for evaluating statements might be overly rigid, leading to misclassifications when dealing with nuanced or complex topics. In Example 2, the statement about biking in a crosswalk is based on a legal requirement that might not be explicitly stated but is part of the broader legal framework. The prompt should consider the possibility that some statements might be true even if specific data is not provided, particularly in contexts like legal regulations or common knowledge.", 'In Example 2, the statement about the health care law being found both constitutional and unconstitutional by different courts is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on legal precedents and official rulings. However, the model incorrectly labeled it as false, indicating that the prompt might not effectively distinguish between claims based on legal facts and those that could be subject to interpretation or multiple outcomes.', 'Example 3 highlights a situation where the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud is a specific claim that needs to be verified against accurate data. The model’s incorrect classification suggests that the prompt may not handle specialized areas like criminal statistics with the necessary granularity, potentially overlooking the need for detailed data analysis.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Charlie Crist breaking a record for fundraising is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on historical data. The model’s incorrect classification points to a lack of robust mechanisms within the prompt to cross-reference claims with verifiable records, especially when dealing with financial achievements that can be objectively measured.', 'Example 5 involves a comparative claim about the number of illegal aliens in Georgia versus Arizona, which requires precise demographic data to verify. The model’s incorrect classification indicates that the prompt might not effectively manage the complexity of comparing statistical data across regions, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated data handling and cross-referencing capabilities.', "The prompt could be missing specific guidance on how to handle claims made by individuals in their roles, such as in Example 4, where Charlie Crist's statement about breaking a record is more likely to be based on internal campaign data rather than public records. This context-specific nuance is important for accurate classification.", 'In Example 5, the statement made by Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. in a campaign TV ad might be seen as a direct recommendation rather than a factual claim, which could warrant a "No" label. The prompt might benefit from a clearer distinction between recommendations and factual statements.', 'The prompt’s criteria for evaluating statements might not adequately consider the intent behind the communication, such as in Example 7, where the Secretary of State’s statement is part of a political debate and not necessarily meant to be taken as a literal fact. The context of the statement as part of a broader discussion might affect its classification.'] items,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. Consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, especially for political figures or candidates expressing personal beliefs or intentions. Account for the time lag in verifying claims and avoid premature classification. Acknowledge that some statements are hyperbolic or rhetorical and should not be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the reliability of sources and evidence without properly considering the nature and context of the claim itself. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about debt levels being higher in 1944 compared to now might be true based on historical data, even if the source is informal like a town hall meeting. The prompt should allow for evaluating the truthfulness of historical claims based on available data, regardless of the source's formality.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Jeff Vanderbeek taking the state into arbitration is likely to be a factual claim about a legal action, which should be evaluated based on the credibility of the source and any legal records, not just the context of a news conference. The prompt needs to clarify that some claims, especially those involving legal actions, should be verified through official records rather than the medium of communication.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the unemployment insurance trust fund, which requires specific financial data to verify. The prompt should emphasize the importance of checking such claims against official government reports or audits, rather than relying solely on the context of an interview. This would help avoid misclassifying claims based on incomplete or outdated data.', 'In Example 4, the statement about one-third of automobile fatalities being due to alcohol is a statistical claim that requires verification from reliable sources like traffic safety reports or studies. The prompt should instruct evaluators to look for such corroborating data before classifying the statement as unsupported, especially when dealing with statistics.', 'Example 5 involves a false claim about Obama putting a 10% tax on tanning, which is clearly a fabricated statement. The prompt should include specific instructions to identify and flag such false or misleading claims, even if they come from a non-traditional source like a TV commercial or reality show. This ensures that false statements are correctly identified regardless of their origin.']

LLM feedbacks:  ["The prompt's evaluation criteria may be too rigidly focused on factual verification and evidence, leading to misclassification of statements that are more about political rhetoric, personal experiences, or hyperbole. For instance, in Example 5, the statement is a claim about the governor's performance, which can be verified through official records or public data, making it a factual claim. However, the prompt's emphasis on evidence and official sources might lead to misclassification when the statement is about a political figure's personal achievements.", "The prompt does not adequately account for the context and intent of the statement, particularly in political contexts. In Example 4, the statement about tax code loopholes is a political claim that reflects the speaker's perspective and policy stance rather than a strict factual assertion. The prompt's focus on factual accuracy might overlook the intended message and exaggerations common in political debates.", "The prompt's criteria for evaluating claims based on evidence might not fully capture the nuance of certain statements, such as those made in media or social media. In Example 7, the statement about MSNBC's response to the Ferguson incident is more about the media's reaction and internal processes, which might not fit neatly into the categories of factual claims or personal experiences. The prompt’s reliance on evidence and official records might not be suitable for evaluating such subjective claims.", "The prompt's criteria for evaluating claims do not sufficiently differentiate between types of sources and their reliability. In Example 6, the statement about Lee Zeldin missing hearings is based on a tweet and a Newsday article, which might not be considered reliable enough for factual verification. The prompt should consider the credibility of the sources more carefully, especially in cases where the statement is made by a candidate for Congress.", "The prompt's approach to evaluating claims based on evidence might not fully recognize the complexity of certain statements, such as those involving statistics or generalizations. In Example 3, the statement about automobile fatalities and alcohol is a generalization that might be supported by statistical evidence, even if not explicitly cited. The prompt should allow for the possibility that some general statements can be true based on broader trends or data, even if not directly verifiable in the given context."]

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the specific context and nuances of political rhetoric and media releases. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about Betty Sutton voting to destroy Medicare might be misleading if it is taken out of context or if the term "destroy" is used in a hyperbolic way. The prompt needs to better handle such cases where the intent and context of the statement are crucial.', 'In Example 3, the statement about the federal tax code having loopholes that incentivize job shipping overseas could be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, especially when made by a political figure. The prompt should allow for such possibilities and not automatically label such statements as false without sufficient contradictory evidence.', 'Example 4 involves a statement about President Obama owning a significant portion of General Motors (GM). This could be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of facts, possibly due to the complexity of ownership structures in large corporations. The prompt should consider the potential for such exaggerations and hyperboles in political rhetoric.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the unemployment insurance trust fund being broke and in debt could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex financial situations. The prompt should acknowledge that such statements might be based on simplified or misleading representations rather than strict factual inaccuracies.', 'Example 6 involves a statement about position eliminations, which could be a comparison made in a way that misrepresents the scale of reductions. The prompt should consider the potential for such comparisons to be misleading or exaggerated, especially when made by someone in a leadership position.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly distinguish between political rhetoric and factual claims, especially in contexts like campaign commercials and advertisements. The examples show that the classifier is classifying statements as lies when they are actually rhetorical or intended to be provocative rather than factually incorrect. A more nuanced understanding of the intent behind the statement and the context in which it was made is necessary.', "The prompt lacks specificity regarding how to handle statements from political figures that are based on their personal beliefs or intentions rather than verifiable facts. This ambiguity led to misclassification in examples where the statement, while possibly hyperbolic, reflects the speaker's personal stance or historical actions, which should not be automatically labeled as false.", 'The prompt does not adequately account for the complexity of evaluating claims made by different types of sources, such as op-ed columns or TV ads, which require a different level of scrutiny depending on their nature. For instance, an op-ed column might contain more subjective commentary, while a TV ad is more focused on persuasive messaging, and these differences should influence the classification.', 'The prompt fails to consider the potential for exaggeration or hyperbole in political statements, particularly those made during campaigning or in media appearances. Statements that are technically false but are also exaggerated or rhetorical in nature can be misclassified as lies when they are not meant to be taken literally.', 'The prompt does not sufficiently address the challenge of verifying claims in the absence of specific details or sources, as seen in cases where the job title, state, party, and context are missing. Without these details, it is difficult to accurately assess the credibility of the statement, leading to potential misclassifications.']

Op-ed columns often contain subjective commentary, while TV ads focus on persuasive messaging. Verify claims against verifiable records and historical data, especially for financial achievements or specific policy impacts. Be mindful of the time lag in data availability and avoid making definitive judgments until sufficient information is gathered. When in doubt, consider the possibility that the statement might be true based on currently unavailable or unverified facts, but also ensure that the statement is not misleading or exaggerated.,

Account for the time lag in verifying claims and avoid premature classification. Acknowledge that some statements are hyperbolic or rhetorical and should not be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.

Additionally, consider the specificity of the job titles and roles. Statements from individuals in authoritative positions, such as governors or sheriffs, should be evaluated with higher scrutiny due to the potential impact of their statements. For example, a Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws or a Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force should be verified immediately and thoroughly, given the potential public safety implications.

Recognize the distinction between absolute and relative statements. A statement about the number of Democratic state senators supporting a bill might be factually incorrect but still reflect a true relative change in support over time. Evaluate such claims by considering the context and any relevant historical data.

When dealing with media or social media statements, consider the nature of the claim and the medium. Statements about media reactions, such as an MSNBC response to an event, may require different criteria for evaluation, focusing more on the context and the media's typical behavior rather than strict factual verification.

Urgent and potentially harmful claims, such as advice to use lethal force, should be classified with high priority and immediate verification, even if they do not align with the standard criteria for factual verification.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. 

When evaluating specific claims, ensure you have access to relevant and up-to-date data. For financial achievements, such as fundraising records, consult official financial reports or databases. For comparative claims involving statistical data, such as the number of illegal aliens in different states, use comprehensive demographic datasets from reliable sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or similar organizations. When a statement refers to the financial status of government funds, such as the unemployment insurance trust fund, consider multiple sources including official budget reports and financial statements. 

For factual claims that may be simplified or misrepresented, such as voting records or policy actions, verify them against the exact legislative records and voting logs. For statistical claims, such as the percentage of automobile fatalities due to alcohol, cross-reference with authoritative sources like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or similar governmental or academic research institutions. 

Account for the time lag in verifying claims and avoid premature classification. Acknowledge that some statements are hyperbolic or rhetorical and should not be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration. In cases where the statement aligns with historical or anecdotal evidence, especially for political figures or candidates expressing personal beliefs or intentions, consider these as valid unless there is clear contradictory evidence.

Differentiate between the literal truth of a statement and its broader implications. A statement may be factually correct but still misleading if it omits critical context or presents a partial truth. Always strive to provide a nuanced evaluation that considers all relevant factors.,

Additionally, recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false due to oversimplification or intentional framing. Evaluate the source and context carefully to understand the intent behind the statement. For claims from op-ed columns or TV ads, apply a higher level of scrutiny given the nature of the content. Op-ed columns often contain subjective commentary, while TV ads focus on persuasive messaging. Verify claims against verifiable records and historical data, especially for financial achievements or specific policy impacts. Be mindful of the time lag in data availability and avoid making definitive judgments until sufficient information is gathered. When in doubt, consider the possibility that the statement might be true based on currently unavailable or unverified facts, but also ensure that the statement is not misleading or exaggerated.

Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. Additionally, distinguish between factual statements and opinions. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, and should be evaluated based on their verifiability. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly.

For example, in Example 1, the statement is about a specific policy detail that could be verified through official documents or press releases from federal agencies. However, the prompt might have failed to recognize this due to its focus on broader evaluation criteria, leading to a misclassification. Similarly, in Example 2, the statement about job creation is aspirational and based on projections, which should be evaluated differently from factual claims. The prompt might have incorrectly classified it as a lie due to its focus on strict factual verification.', "The prompt's emphasis on verifying statements against real data and official records might have led to incorrect classifications in cases where the statements are more subjective or aspirational. In Example 3, the statement about corporate tax incentives is likely based on expert analysis and economic models rather than direct factual data. The prompt's rigid criteria for factual verification might have caused it to misclassify such statements as lies. This highlights the need for the prompt to consider the type of statement and the context in which it is made.", "The prompt's approach to distinguishing between factual statements and opinions might be too stringent, leading to misclassifications in cases like Example 4. Here, the statement about releasing tax returns is more of a commitment or assertion rather than a factual claim. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie because it did not adequately account for the difference between a factual claim and a statement of intent. This suggests that the prompt needs to be more nuanced in its evaluation of different types of statements.", "The prompt's strict criteria for classifying statements as lies might have caused it to miss the context and intent behind certain statements, as seen in Example 5. The statement about a future speaker of the House being on the ballot one time is more about political strategy and timing rather than a factual claim. The prompt might have misclassified it as a lie because it did not recognize the aspirational and speculative nature of the statement. This indicates that the prompt needs to better handle statements that reflect future plans or aspirations.", "In Examples 6 and 7, the statements about Obamacare and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reporting to many committees might be based on subjective perceptions or political rhetoric rather than verifiable facts. The prompt's focus on strict factual verification might have led to incorrect classifications. These examples highlight the need for the prompt to consider the context and the nature of the statement, recognizing that some statements are more about perception and political messaging than factual claims.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt\'s criteria for determining whether a statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) may be too rigidly focused on the presence or absence of supporting evidence, potentially overlooking the context and intent behind the statement. In Examples 1 through 5, the statements are presented in political contexts where aspirational or hyperbolic language might be common, and the criteria for "lying" might not fully account for this. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about green card holders being in the military might be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the situation, but it doesn\'t necessarily mean the speaker is lying; it could be a simplified or dramatized version of a complex issue.', "The prompt does not adequately distinguish between aspirational statements and factual claims, which can lead to incorrect classifications. In Examples 6 and 8, the statements about Medicaid expansion and vaccination rates are factual claims about actions taken by the speaker. However, the prompt's criteria for verifying such statements might be too stringent, leading to incorrect classifications. For example, in Example 6, the statement about Medicaid expansion is a factual claim about policy decisions made by the governor, which can be verified through official records and policies.", "The prompt’s evaluation criteria do not sufficiently account for the nuances of political discourse, where statements might be made for rhetorical effect or to convey a broader message. In Examples 3 and 7, the statements about Rep. John Katko's voting record and Sharron Angle's proposed elimination of the Department of Education are aspirational statements meant to criticize the opposition rather than factual claims. The prompt might be too literal in its interpretation, classifying these as lies when they are more accurately described as political rhetoric.", 'The prompt’s criteria for evaluating the reliability of sources might be overly strict, particularly in contexts where the speaker is making broad claims that are difficult to verify immediately. In Examples 2 and 4, the statements about tax code loopholes and federal grants are broad claims that might be challenging to verify in real-time during a debate or interview. The prompt might require more flexibility in evaluating such statements, recognizing that while they might not be immediately verifiable, they could still be part of a larger narrative or argument.', 'The prompt does not explicitly address the role of personal experiences or opinions in political statements, which can be presented as factual claims. In Example 7, the statement about gun seizures in Chicago might be based on personal experiences or a broader narrative rather than verifiable data. The prompt needs to account for the distinction between verifiable facts and aspirational statements or those based on personal experiences, ensuring that the classification is appropriate given the context and nature of the statement.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt focuses heavily on factual claims and evidence-based verification, which may lead to misclassification of aspirational statements or opinions, especially in political contexts. The examples show that the prompt incorrectly classified statements about political promises, policy positions, and historical claims as false when they were actually true or accurate according to the given context. This suggests that the prompt needs more nuanced guidance on distinguishing between factual claims and political rhetoric or aspirational goals.', 'The prompt does not adequately account for the nature of the speaker and their role, particularly in political settings. Statements made by politicians, especially during campaigns or interviews, often reflect their personal beliefs, campaign promises, or party platforms rather than factual verifications. The examples indicate that the prompt failed to recognize these statements as potentially true based on the context, instead treating them as unsupported claims.', 'The prompt lacks clarity on how to handle statements that are difficult to verify due to the nature of the claim itself, such as historical claims or claims about past actions. For instance, the statement "Obama has never visited Israel" requires a thorough investigation into Obama\'s travel history, which might be challenging to confirm definitively. The examples show that the prompt did not consider the difficulty in verifying some claims, leading to incorrect classifications.', 'The prompt’s focus on strict factual verification may not always align with the expectations of political discourse. Political statements often contain elements of opinion, aspiration, or rhetoric that are not necessarily false but may not be verifiable in traditional fact-checking methods. The examples demonstrate that the prompt did not adequately account for the context and intent behind such statements, leading to misclassifications.', 'The prompt does not provide clear guidelines on how to handle statements that are based on subjective experiences or opinions, even if they are presented as factual. For example, the statement "Republicans will own 60% of GM" is more of an opinion or prediction rather than a factual claim that can be easily verified. The examples suggest that the prompt may have incorrectly classified such statements as false because it did not differentiate between factual claims and subjective opinions.']

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt might be getting these examples wrong because it places too much emphasis on the need for statements to be supported by "real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources." This criterion can be overly restrictive, especially in contexts where the information is aspirational, based on personal experience, or part of a broader narrative that doesn\'t necessarily require absolute factual verification. The examples provided involve statements that, while potentially exaggerated or inaccurate, do not clearly contradict available data or reliable sources. Therefore, the prompt should allow for more flexibility in evaluating statements that are more subjective or based on personal experiences or political narratives.', 'The prompt might also be misinterpreting the context and job titles. Statements made by politicians or public figures often carry weight due to their position and the influence they wield, even if the specific details are not fully verifiable. The examples show statements from politicians and columnists that, while possibly misleading, are not easily dismissed as false without further investigation. The prompt needs to account for the potential impact and credibility of such statements, especially when made by public officials or influential figures.', 'The prompt could be failing to adequately distinguish between aspirational and factual statements, particularly in political contexts. Aspirational statements, like those made during political campaigns, often reflect a vision or a goal rather than a strictly factual claim. While these statements should still be evaluated for their verifiability, the prompt seems to treat them as if they must meet the same standards as factual claims. This rigid approach can lead to incorrect classifications, as seen in examples where aspirational statements are labeled as false when they are more accurately described as vague or unverified.', 'The prompt might not be properly weighing the reliability of the source. In some cases, the context and the source of the statement are crucial in determining its accuracy. For example, a statement made in a political campaign or a media interview might be more credible than one made in a less formal setting. The examples show that the prompt does not sufficiently consider the reliability of the source, leading to misclassifications. A more nuanced approach that takes into account the context and the credibility of the source would improve the accuracy of the predictions.', 'The prompt could be missing the nuance in how statements are presented and the implications of certain phrasings. For instance, statements that use broad generalizations or hyperbolic language might be classified incorrectly if the prompt focuses solely on literal accuracy. Examples like the statement about tanning taxes or the one about "green card holders" might be seen as false because they are exaggerated, but the prompt should recognize that such statements can be part of a larger narrative or argument, and their truthfulness might require a more contextual evaluation.']

Additionally, distinguish between factual statements and opinions. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, and should be evaluated based on their verifiability. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly. 

When dealing with political statements, recognize that candidates often make clear and direct political stances, which may be widely understood and accepted within their party or constituency. Evaluate these statements in the context of the speaker's usual public persona and the norms of political discourse. Personal experiences or aspirations should be treated with caution; while they may reflect genuine intentions, they do not necessarily require extensive external verification unless they make specific factual claims.

In cases where the context is limited, refrain from making definitive judgments until more information is available. Statements about financial expenditures or other specific actions should be verified against official records or statements from relevant parties. When in doubt, consider the possibility that the statement may be an opinion or an aspirational goal rather than a factual claim, and evaluate it accordingly.

By taking these factors into account, ensure that your classification is based on a thorough understanding of the statement's context, the reliability of the information provided, and the nature of the claim being made. Avoid labeling as lies statements that are aspirational or reflect personal experiences, unless they are demonstrably false or contradict verifiable facts.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context.

Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly. 

Moreover, evaluate the credibility of the speaker, particularly in political settings, where statements can carry significant weight. Assess whether the speaker has a history of verifiable claims or if they are known for making unsubstantiated statements. For significant claims that could cause public harm, such as advising citizens to use lethal force, verify the statement immediately and thoroughly. 

When dealing with comparative claims, such as the number of illegal aliens in different states, ensure that you have access to precise demographic data from credible sources before making a judgment. Cross-reference multiple reliable datasets to ensure accuracy. 

Be mindful of the nuances in language and the complexity of real-world situations. Statements can be misleading without being outright lies. For example, the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context. Evaluate such statements based on the context and the availability of supporting evidence. 

Finally, recognize the importance of the speaker's position and the context in which the statement is made. For instance, a statement from the Governor of New Jersey about tenure laws, made at a reputable institution, is more likely to be accurate. Adjust your evaluation criteria based on these factors to ensure a more nuanced and accurate assessment.,

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. 

Additionally, when dealing with statements supported by multiple conflicting sources, use a nuanced approach to evaluate the credibility of each source and determine the most likely truth. If the statement is part of a formal and public address, such as a major foreign policy speech, consider the context as a policy position rather than a personal opinion. Statements that could cause immediate public harm, such as advice to use lethal force, require urgent verification due to their potential impact. Some statements, especially those made during political debates or campaigns, may be aspirational or rhetorical and should be evaluated based on their verifiability rather than strict factual accuracy. 

For claims that are difficult to verify due to the nature of the claim itself, such as historical claims or claims about past actions, use all available resources and context to make an informed decision. If the truthfulness of the statement cannot be definitively confirmed or denied, classify it based on the preponderance of evidence and the reliability of the sources. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly, keeping in mind that some claims may require more rigorous scrutiny than others.,

Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly.

Be mindful of common misperceptions and political rhetoric. Statements that are widely believed but lack factual support should be classified as "Yes" if they are not corroborated by reliable sources. For example, assertions about the state of the Social Security system being "broke" should be critically evaluated against actual financial reports and expert analyses.

Acknowledge the potential for exaggeration and hyperbole in political rhetoric. Claims about individuals' ownership stakes in large corporations, such as President Obama's involvement with General Motors, should be scrutinized for their accuracy and the complexity of corporate structures. If the claim cannot be substantiated through official records or credible reports, classify it as "Yes."

Recognize the urgency and potential for misinformation in significant claims that could lead to public harm. Statements like Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force require immediate verification and should be closely examined for their reliability and context. The prompt should emphasize the importance of verifying such statements promptly to prevent misinformation.

Understand that claims about legislative achievements, such as passing a bipartisan Medicaid bill, can be true in the context of the legislative process, even if the process was complex and challenging. Evaluate these statements based on the final outcome and relevant legislative records.

Consider the context and potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements from high-ranking officials, especially during political campaigns. Statements made in such settings should be evaluated for their verifiability and alignment with available evidence, recognizing that they might not always align with strict factual verification due to the nature of political discourse.

By incorporating these considerations, the model will better account for common misperceptions, political rhetoric, and the urgency of verifying critical claims, leading to more accurate classifications.,

To better handle the nuances of different types of statements:
- For relative claims (such as economic trends), evaluate them based on the context and trend analysis rather than requiring absolute factual verification.
- For statements in campaign materials, consider the persuasive intent and the likelihood of the claim being true within the context of the campaign message.
- For personal experiences or aspirations, assess them based on their plausibility and alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute proof.

By considering these factors, you can more accurately classify the truthfulness of the statements.,

Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly. 

For statements that are more about personal opinions or past actions rather than verifiable facts, evaluate them based on their verifiability and the context in which they were made. For example, a statement like "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill passed" should be evaluated based on the expectations and perceptions at the time, which can be subjective and harder to prove definitively, but still should be checked against any available data or expert opinions.

For complex claims, especially those involving economic or legal terms, ensure you have a good understanding of the relevant concepts and use expert knowledge or detailed research to verify the accuracy of the statement. For instance, when dealing with statements about corporate tax deductions, consult tax laws and economic policies to determine the validity of the claim.

When verifying claims, be aware that the prompt’s approach might sometimes be overly strict. In cases where official sources are not readily available or relevant, use other reliable sources to support your assessment. For example, in Example 2, if government reports or health care spending data are not available, consider other credible sources that might provide relevant information.

Statements that lack specific details, such as those regarding promises made without clear benchmarks, should be evaluated based on the broader context and the likelihood of the claim being true given the available information. For example, in Example 3, if Joni Ernst's promises are vague and difficult to verify, consider the general context of her campaign and the typical nature of political rhetoric.

Finally, understand that political discourse often includes ideological framing and aspirational language. Statements should be interpreted within this broader context. For example, in Example 1, the statement about tax contributions by the top 1 percent is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of tax policy and economic data. Evaluate the statement by considering the broader context of political and economic discussions and the available data on tax contributions.

In summary, while the primary focus remains on factual accuracy, be flexible and consider the context, source credibility, and the nature of the statement when making your evaluation.,

For statements involving financial data, such as the unemployment insurance trust fund, check against official government reports or audits to ensure the claim is accurate. For historical claims or claims about past actions, a thorough investigation into the relevant records and historical data is necessary. In political discourse, consider the broader context and ideological framing, and evaluate statements based on their alignment with available data and the complexity of the issue. The nature of the statement and its context should guide your evaluation criteria, taking into account the potential for exaggeration or hyperbole in political rhetoric. Recognize that some statements might be true even if specific data is not provided, particularly in contexts like legal regulations or common knowledge. 

When classifying statements, consider the possibility that some claims might be exaggerated or presented in a way that simplifies complex issues. Evaluate the statement's alignment with broader trends, policies, and historical data, and recognize the role of rhetorical style in shaping public perception. Use a combination of rigorous fact-checking and contextual analysis to arrive at the most accurate classification.,

Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly. Recognize that some statements may be true based on historical actions or statements, even if they haven't been officially recorded. For example, if a statement suggests that a politician advocated for a policy in the past, evaluate it based on their known public actions, speeches, or historical records. Similarly, statements involving complex issues, such as legislative actions, should be evaluated within the broader context of the issue and the available evidence. 

For statements that are difficult to verify due to the nature of the claim itself, consider the reliability of the source and the plausibility of the claim. Historical claims or claims about past actions may require more extensive research, but should still be evaluated based on the best available evidence. 

In cases where the context indicates that the statement is part of a political debate or campaign rhetoric, evaluate it based on the political context and the likelihood of the claim being made in that context, rather than strict factual verification alone. Recognize that political statements often reflect aspirations or campaign promises rather than definitive facts, and should be evaluated based on their alignment with the broader political narrative and the available evidence.

Opinion pieces often contain subjective views rather than verifiable facts, so classify them appropriately based on their content and context. When dealing with complex claims or statements that involve historical data or specific events, ensure that you consider both the direct evidence and the broader context to make an accurate assessment.,

Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly.

When dealing with statements from politicians who have changed their positions over time, consider the speaker's evolving stance and how that affects the truthfulness of their current statement. Statements may reflect a speaker's past actions or beliefs, which might not align with their current position. Evaluate the statement based on its current context and the speaker's current role and responsibilities.

In cases where the context does not provide explicit labels such as job title, state, or party affiliation, use your best judgment based on the available information. If the context is ambiguous, consider the general reputation and past actions of the speaker to inform your evaluation.

Relative claims, such as those involving economic trends or job creation, should be evaluated within the broader context of the overall trend. A statement can be true if it reflects a part of the larger picture, even if it does not represent the peak or absolute numbers. Consider the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement, as informal communications like tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation that are common in such settings. Account for these factors when making your determination.,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. Additionally, distinguish between factual statements and opinions. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, and should be evaluated based on their verifiability. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences should be assessed for their alignment with available evidence and context, rather than requiring absolute factual verification. Consider the nature of the statement and adjust your evaluation criteria accordingly. 

When dealing with political statements, recognize that candidates often make clear and direct political stances, which may be widely understood and accepted within their party or constituency. Evaluate these statements in the context of the speaker's usual public persona and the norms of political discourse. Personal experiences or aspirations should be treated with caution; while they may reflect genuine intentions, they do not necessarily require extensive external verification unless they make specific factual claims.

In cases where the context is limited, refrain from making definitive judgments until more information is available. Statements about financial expenditures or other specific actions should be verified against official records or statements from relevant parties. When in doubt, consider the possibility that the statement may be an opinion or an aspirational goal rather than a factual claim, and evaluate it accordingly.

By taking these factors into account, ensure that your classification is based on a thorough understanding of the statement's context, the reliability of the information provided, and the nature of the claim being made. Avoid labeling as lies statements that are aspirational or reflect personal experiences, unless they are demonstrably false or contradict verifiable facts.

Similarly, in Example 8, the statement about Mitt Romney flip-flopping on abortion is an opinion-based claim that can be evaluated through political records and public statements, yet the prompt incorrectly classifies it as a lie because it lacks verifiable data.', 'The prompt does not adequately address the context and source of information, particularly in political and media contexts. In Examples 2 and 6, the statements are from sources like a video promo and a radio ad, which are not typically reliable for factual claims.

Instead, it should focus on whether the statement is supported by verifiable facts or if it is an exaggeration or opinion.', 'The prompt\'s criteria for what constitutes a "lie" are too narrow and do not differentiate between aspirational statements and factual claims. In Example 7, the statement about the federal government lending money to Brazil is likely false, but the prompt fails to recognize this due to its strict requirement for verifiable data. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences, while not strictly factual, can still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context, which the prompt does not sufficiently consider.', 'The prompt does not properly account for the nuances of political language and the use of hyperbole. In Example 4, the statement about federal spending being discretionary is an oversimplification that can be misleading but is not necessarily a lie. The prompt should recognize that political statements often use simplified language to convey broader points and should evaluate them based on their intent and verifiability rather than strict factual alignment.', "The prompt's evaluation of statements is overly dependent on the presence of direct evidence, which can lead to misclassification of statements that are clearly false but lack direct evidence. In Example 5, the statement about debt levels is demonstrably false based on historical data, but the prompt fails to recognize this because it does not explicitly mention checking against official records or reliable sources.

LLM feedbacks:  ['The prompt\'s criteria for classifying statements as "Yes" or "No" might be too rigid, leading to misclassifications. For example, in Example 1, the statement about the Pasco County budget doubling in three years seems to be directly supported by a Newsday article, which would typically warrant a "No" classification. However, if the article is from a reputable source and provides detailed figures, the statement should be considered factual unless disproven, which aligns with a "No" classification. The prompt might need to include more flexibility in considering the credibility and verifiability of the sources mentioned.', 'The prompt\'s focus on official records and reliable sources might not fully account for the nuances of political statements and aspirational claims. In Example 2, the statement about twenty percent of young adults not working could be a genuine statistic, even if the exact percentage is debatable. The context of an interview suggests that the speaker might be using a generalization to make a broader point, and the statement could be classified as "No" if it is supported by credible data. The prompt should consider that political claims often aim to convey a message rather than present precise facts.', 'Example 3 highlights the issue of verifying claims against specific evidence. The statement about Lee Zeldin missing two-thirds of Veterans Affairs Hearings is likely to be supported by a specific record or report. The prompt should ensure that the classification is based on the availability and reliability of such evidence, rather than a general assumption that political claims are exaggerated. The "Yes" label here indicates that the claim is backed by a verifiable source, which the model incorrectly classified as "No".', 'In Example 4, the statement about Obama putting a 10 percent tax on tanning is clearly false and can be easily verified. The model’s prediction of "Yes" suggests that the system might be too lenient in evaluating aspirational or exaggerated claims, especially when they are demonstrably false. The prompt needs to emphasize the importance of recognizing and labeling such claims as false when there is clear evidence to support the fact-checking.', 'Example 5 demonstrates the challenge of distinguishing between factual claims and aspirational statements. Jeff Vanderbeek taking the New Jersey Devils into arbitration might be a factual claim supported by legal documents, making it a "No" classification. The model’s "Yes" prediction indicates that it might be conflating aspirational claims with factual ones.

For instance, claiming that a high-speed rail project would create "60,000-plus jobs" might be an exaggeration but not necessarily a lie if it aims to highlight potential job creation benefits. The prompt’s focus on verifiability can sometimes result in labeling such statements as lies without considering their purpose or context.', 'The prompt’s requirement for statements to be supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources can be too stringent for certain political or aspirational statements.

This type of statement might be labeled as a lie because it cannot be immediately verified, even though it is not inherently false.', 'The prompt does not clearly distinguish between statements that are purely aspirational or reflect personal experiences and those that contain factual claims. Statements like "On mandating health care coverage" and "In 2010, Betty Sutton voted to destroy Medicare" are based on political actions and can be verified through official records or news releases, making them factual claims. However, the prompt’s emphasis on verifiability might lead to misclassification of aspirational or opinion-based statements as lies.', 'The prompt’s evaluation criteria might be too rigid for statements that are part of a broader narrative or argument. For example, a statement about the economic situation in 1944 being more severe than now might be based on a specific perspective or narrative rather than a universally accepted fact. The prompt’s focus on strict factual verification might overlook the context and intent behind such statements, leading to misclassification.']

For instance, in Example 1, the governor\'s statements about vaccination rates are verifiable through public health records, yet the prompt classifies them as "Yes" due to a lack of explicit data references, which is incorrect.', "The prompt also fails to account for the role of context and the nature of the job title in determining the verifiability of statements.

This highlights the need for the prompt to better distinguish between aspirational or speculative statements and factual claims that can be substantiated.', 'The prompt\'s rigid adherence to the need for "reliable sources" can lead to misclassification in political contexts, as seen in Example 4. A public appearance and op-ed by a politician discussing their stance on voting for a budget proposal does not require external verification but should be classified based on the politician\'s declared position. The prompt’s emphasis on external data sources misses the point of evaluating the statement\'s verifiability within the given context.', 'Example 5 involves a statement about the immigration status of U.S. forces, which can be verified through military records or official statements.

Statements like Charlie Crist breaking a record for fundraising should be evaluated based on historical data to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe prompt should account for the potential for exaggerations and hyperboles in political rhetoric. For example, statements about ownership structures in large corporations like General Motors can be complex and subject to misinterpretation. \n\nStatements that are aspirational or speculative should not be automatically classified as lies if they reflect future intentions or historical claims that are not easily verifiable at the time of the statement. Examples include statements about future political positions or historical financial data that are not yet finalized. \n\nLastly, the prompt should better account for the intent behind statements that are partially true but misleading. For instance, a statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation.

Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, may be expressions of opinion or exaggerations rather than factual assertions. The model should also consider the specificity and context of the claim, such as specialized areas like criminal statistics, and the potential for misleading comparisons or exaggerations, especially when made by individuals in leadership positions. In political discourse, statements often include ideological framing, and the prompt should guide the model to interpret such statements within the broader context of political and economic discussions. Additionally, the model should not dismiss a statement solely because it comes from a less formal source; if the data supports the claim, it should be classified as "No". Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, may be expressions of opinion or exaggerations rather than factual assertions. In such cases, evaluate the statement based on its verifiability and the context in which it was made. 

The model should also consider the nuances in political statements where exaggeration or hyperbole is common. For example, a statement about increasing spending by $12.5 billion might be seen as hyperbolic in a political context and should be evaluated based on the intent and context rather than strict numerical verification alone. 

For factual claims, especially those related to financial achievements or records, the prompt should include robust mechanisms to cross-reference claims with verifiable records. Statements like Charlie Crist breaking a record for fundraising should be evaluated based on historical data to ensure accuracy.

The prompt should account for the potential for exaggerations and hyperboles in political rhetoric. For example, statements about ownership structures in large corporations like General Motors can be complex and subject to misinterpretation. 

Statements that are aspirational or speculative should not be automatically classified as lies if they reflect future intentions or historical claims that are not easily verifiable at the time of the statement. Examples include statements about future political positions or historical financial data that are not yet finalized. 

Lastly, the prompt should better account for the intent behind statements that are partially true but misleading. For instance, a statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation. Evaluate the statement based on its overall alignment with facts and the context in which it was made, rather than just the verifiability of each component. 

Use these guidelines to evaluate and classify each statement accurately, balancing factual accuracy with the context and intent behind the statement.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information.

In such cases, evaluate the statement based on its verifiability and the context in which it was made. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. 

For straightforward claims, such as those about political stances, compare them directly with known positions and avoid overcomplicating the verification process. For claims involving legal actions, verify through official records and credible legal sources. Do not rely solely on the context of the communication medium. Ensure that you account for the complexity of political discourse by considering the possibility that statements, although potentially misleading, might be true based on unverified or unknown facts. 

When evaluating statements in different contexts, such as fundraising letters, press releases, or tweets, use a consistent approach to verify the truthfulness. Simplified or misleading statistics should be critically assessed using available data and official records. Distinguish between factual claims and aspirational statements, ensuring that aspirational claims are evaluated based on their verifiability and context. 

In summary, focus on the verifiability of the statement, the reliability of the source, and the context in which it was made. Avoid misclassifying statements due to a lack of available information or a misunderstanding of the statement's nature.,

In such cases, evaluate the statement based on its verifiability and the context in which it was made. Aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context.

Additionally, consider the complexity and nuance of statements, especially those made by public figures. Recognize that statements may be true within certain contexts or timeframes, even if they do not align with a general perception. Evaluate the credibility and expertise of the speaker when assessing the statement's accuracy.

Ensure that you consider a broader range of reliable sources, including recent census data, sports league records, and internal campaign data, to determine the veracity of factual claims. Be cautious of statements that rely on subjective assessments or personal experiences, and evaluate them based on their consistency with available data and context.

Statistical claims require verification from reliable sources such as traffic safety reports or studies. Look for corroborating data to support the statement before classifying it as unsupported. Understand that some statements may be aspirational or reflect future intentions, and evaluate them based on their context and potential verifiability in the future.

By considering these factors, you will be able to provide more accurate classifications of statements, taking into account the complexities and nuances of the information presented.

In Example 2, the context is from a promotional video for "Jersey Shore," which is entertainment content, and the statement itself is hyperbolic and likely false. However, the prompt\'s detailed evaluation process might have overlooked the entertainment context, leading to a misclassification.', 'The prompt\'s approach to evaluating the reliability of the source might be too stringent, especially in cases where the source is political and the claim is aspirational rather than verifiable. In Example 5, the statement about reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank is a political claim that doesn\'t require rigorous fact-checking to be classified as "Yes." The prompt’s emphasis on official records and reliable sources might have led to an incorrect classification.', 'Lastly, the prompt might not adequately account for the nature of the job title and state information, which in some cases can provide context that is critical for classification. For instance, in Example 3, the job title and state information suggest a political context, which should influence the classification towards "Yes" for a claim about budget doubling, even if the claim is speculative. The prompt’s lack of flexibility in interpreting these contextual elements contributed to the misclassification.']

When the context suggests that the statement is part of a broader discussion or debate, assess the statement within that context rather than in isolation. The role and credibility of the speaker, especially in a political setting, should also be considered. Handle statements involving comparisons carefully, ensuring that they are not misleading or exaggerated, especially when made by someone in a leadership position. Recognize that sometimes claims can be true based on past actions or statements, even if not officially recorded. Use historical data or specific events to support your evaluation when available.,

  prompt: Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. Additionally, handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking by considering the plausibility and supporting evidence. For aspirational or personal statements, evaluate them based on the provided context and the likelihood of the claim being true. Consider historical data or specific events when evaluating the truthfulness of claims, recognizing that sometimes claims can be true based on past actions or statements, even if not officially recorded. 

Be flexible in your evaluation approach to accommodate various types of statements. Recognize that statements reflecting personal opinions, past actions, or subjective experiences do not necessarily require external verification to be classified as true or false. For example, statements like "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill passed" are more about expectations and perceptions, which can be subjective and harder to prove definitively. Similarly, statements expressing personal beliefs, such as "I'm pro-life. He's not," should be evaluated based on the context and the likelihood of the claim being true, rather than requiring external verification.

Statements that are based on subjective experiences or opinions, even if presented as factual, should be evaluated based on the provided context and the likelihood of the claim being true. For instance, the statement "Republicans will own 60% of GM" is more of an opinion or prediction rather than a factual claim that can be easily verified. The prompt should recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false.

When evaluating statements that are political oversimplifications or misrepresentations of complex policy impacts, recognize that these can be misleading but may not necessarily be false. For example, the statement about halting EPA regulation helping stop rising gas prices could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts. The prompt should acknowledge that some statements, while potentially misleading, may not be factually incorrect.

The approach to verifying claims through reliable sources should be consistent but flexible. In cases where the statement is a prediction or an opinion, the absence of definitive proof from official sources may not automatically classify it as false, especially if the context supports the likelihood of the statement being true. However, when there is conflicting data or significant evidence against the statement, it should be classified as false.,

To improve accuracy, consider the following:
- Statements expressing personal beliefs or opinions, such as those about gay marriage, should be evaluated based on the clarity and support of the claim within the given context, rather than solely on factual verifiability.
- When there is insufficient context or limited information available, refrain from classifying the statement as a lie until more details become available.
- Be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid premature classification. Wait for comprehensive data to become available before making a judgment.
- Verify claims against known financial records or statements from relevant parties to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with specific spending or financial activities.
- Identify and flag false or misleading claims, even if they originate from non-traditional sources like TV commercials or reality shows, by cross-referencing with credible and up-to-date information.,

Specifically, identify and flag false or misleading claims, even if they come from non-traditional sources like television commercials or reality shows. Ensure that the evaluation is not influenced by the speaker's job title or potential bias, such as in the case of an advocacy group. When dealing with comparative claims, such as those involving statistical data across regions, use precise and cross-referenced data to verify the accuracy of the statement. Consider the speaker's evolving stance over time, especially for politicians, and how that affects the truthfulness of their current statement. Ensure a consistent approach to evaluating statements by verifying their accuracy in the given context, whether it is a fundraising letter, a press release, or a tweet. Handle simplified or misleading statistics carefully, ensuring that the overall claim is supported by accurate and relevant data.,

For comparative claims involving statistical data across regions, ensure to cross-reference multiple reliable sources to verify the accuracy of the comparison. Be cautious of statements that make broad generalizations without clear evidence, such as claims about the number of illegal aliens in different states.

For statements that involve scientific claims, such as the potential poisoning of babies by cigarette butts, consider the underlying scientific principles and studies to determine the validity of the claim. Recognize that while such claims might be exaggerated, they can still have a basis in scientific research, and such evaluations should not be dismissed outright.

When dealing with speculative or forward-looking statements, such as claims about a country's relative position among developed nations or future policy impacts, assess the plausibility of the claim and the availability of evidence or historical trends that support it. Understand that these types of statements often involve complex factors and may require a broader analysis beyond simple factual verification.

Be mindful of the context in which statements are made, particularly in political or economic discussions. Statements that simplify complex issues or present misleading information without clear evidence should be identified as potentially misleading, even if they are not outright lies. Recognize that terms like "flip-flopping" often carry political connotations and may not necessarily indicate a lack of factual accuracy.

In all cases, provide a detailed justification for your classification, explaining how you assessed the reliability of the claim, the available data, and the source of the information. This will help ensure that your evaluation is thorough and accurate.,

  prompt: # Task
Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is an exaggeration/hyperbole without basis, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context and any specific details provided, and differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. When evaluating the accuracy of a statement, consider both the source and the content for any inconsistencies or unsupported claims. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, and recognize that aspirational statements or those reflecting personal experiences may not always align with strict factual verification but should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context. Additionally, handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking by considering the plausibility and supporting evidence. For aspirational or personal statements, evaluate them based on the provided context and the likelihood of the claim being true, considering the nature of the source and its intent. In cases where the statement is subjective or aimed at evoking a response rather than presenting verifiable facts, such as in fundraising letters or promotional materials, evaluate its veracity based on the intended purpose and the context provided. For statements that reflect media reactions or internal processes, such as those made in media or social media, consider the context and the nature of the claim. The prompt's criteria for evaluating claims based on evidence should be flexible enough to accommodate these nuances while maintaining a focus on factual accuracy. When interpreting the relationship between the statement and the given context, consider the specific details and the nature of the source to avoid misclassification.

  feedbacks: ['The prompt may be too simplistic, expecting a binary "lie" or "not a lie" without considering the nuances of the context, job title, and party affiliation. For instance, in Example 3, the statement about New Jersey\'s tenure law reform could be factually correct but the prediction being "No" suggests the model didn\'t account for the speaker\'s role as the Governor, who would have direct influence over such reforms.', 'In Example 1, the model might not have correctly interpreted the context as an opinion piece, leading it to incorrectly label the statement as false. Opinion pieces often contain subjective views rather than verifiable facts, which the model might not recognize.', 'Example 2 highlights that the model might be overly literal and miss the intended meaning. The statement reflects personal experience rather than a factual claim, which the model could interpret as a lie due to its lack of verifiability.', 'For Example 4, the model might not have considered the context of political debates where statements are often hyperbolic or exaggerated for rhetorical effect. The model may need to understand that such statements are common in political rhetoric and should not always be taken at face value.', 'In Example 5, the model might have struggled with the context of an interview, where statements can be based on personal beliefs or opinions rather than verifiable facts. The model needs to better distinguish between factual claims and personal narratives.', 'The prompt may be failing because it does not adequately consider the context and specific details provided in each example. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the news station covering New Jersey government might be true based on the context provided, but the prompt\'s generic approach might lead to the incorrect prediction of "No". The model needs to be more nuanced in how it interprets the relationship between the statement and the given context.', 'Another reason could be the lack of specificity in the job titles and roles. In Example 4, the Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws would likely be accurate, especially if the context is a speech at a reputable institution. The model might need better training to recognize the credibility of statements based on the speaker’s position and the context.', 'The prompt might also be failing due to insufficient understanding of political and economic contexts. In Example 5, the statement about Medicare passing with little Republican support could be true based on historical facts, but the model might not have the necessary knowledge base to determine this accurately without additional context or training.', 'In Examples 6 and 8, the model might be struggling with identifying factual statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context. For Example 6, the governor discussing income taxes in Ohio compared to Texas and Oklahoma might be accurate based on known policies, but the model’s generic approach might lead to a false negative.', "Lastly, the model might be overgeneralizing the accuracy of statements made by public figures, regardless of the context. In Example 7, the statement about the deficit being largely due to past policies and the recession could be true, but the model might not account for the complexities of economic policy or the speaker's credibility well enough.", 'The prompt is too broad and lacks specificity in defining what constitutes a lie. It does not clearly outline the criteria for determining if a statement is false based on the context, job title, party affiliation, or the source of the statement. This ambiguity leads to inconsistent interpretations and incorrect predictions.', 'The prompt does not account for the reliability of sources or the accuracy of information provided. For instance, statements made by politicians or public figures may contain inaccuracies due to misinformation, exaggeration, or misinterpretation, which the current prompt does not consider.', 'The prompt fails to address the temporal aspect of the information. Statements made in the past might be true at the time but become false later due to changes in circumstances. Without considering the current status or recent developments, the classifier may incorrectly label statements as lies.', 'The prompt does not differentiate between opinions and factual statements. Opinions can be expressed as facts, especially during political debates or campaigns, leading to misclassification. The classifier needs to distinguish between statements that are verifiable facts versus subjective opinions.', 'The prompt does not provide guidelines on how to handle conflicting information or multiple pieces of evidence. In cases where there is contradictory information, the classifier should weigh the evidence before making a determination, rather than relying solely on the given context.', 'In Example 2, the statement comparing hunting and fishing license holders to voters might be a lie if the actual data shows a different ratio. The classifier needs to check against real data or reliable sources to determine the veracity of such claims, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', "Example 3 involves a statement about a right-wing group's spending in the primary election. This might be a lie if the group did not spend as much as claimed. The prompt should instruct the classifier to verify claims against known financial records or statements from the relevant parties.", "For Example 4, the statement about Danny Tarkanian's positions on Planned Parenthood and abortion rights might be misleading if the candidate has not officially stated these positions. The classifier needs to differentiate between a candidate's stated positions and speculations or misrepresentations.", 'In Example 5, the statement about the Democratic National Convention’s lack of mentions on ISIS might be a lie if the convention did indeed discuss the topic. The classifier should be instructed to cross-check against official transcripts or reports from the event to ensure the statement aligns with the actual content.', "The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the credibility of the speaker or the source of the information. In Example 1, the speaker is a Democrat in a debate, which might influence the statement's accuracy. The prompt should consider the speaker's role and party affiliation, especially in political contexts, to better assess the reliability of the claim.", 'The context provided in some examples, such as Example 6, might not always include enough information to verify the claim. The prompt should emphasize the importance of cross-referencing the statement with multiple reliable sources, rather than relying solely on the context provided.', 'The prompt focuses too much on whether the statement is supported by data or contradicts available data, but it does not adequately address the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in statements. Examples like Example 4, where the statement mentions a future event, might be more about aspiration rather than a factual claim, and thus should not necessarily be labeled as false without additional context.', 'The prompt fails to acknowledge the distinction between absolute and relative statements. In Example 8, while the statement about the five Democratic state senators might be factually incorrect, it could still be a true relative statement if the number of senators in favor or against the bill has changed over time. The prompt should clarify how to handle relative claims versus absolute claims.', "The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly focuses on the reliability of the claim being supported by real data or official records, which can be subjective and varies greatly depending on the topic. In some cases, the statement might be a common belief or a specific claim within a certain context that doesn't necessarily need to be backed by official records to be considered accurate. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about having more children's hospitals might be a well-known fact within Ohio, even if it isn't widely reported in national data. The prompt needs to account for such contextual and local truths.", "The prompt could be missing the nuance required to handle complex claims that involve historical data or specific events. In Example 4, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for eliminating all corporate taxes might be true based on historical actions or statements, even if it hasn't been officially recorded. The prompt needs to consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, rather than just verifiable data.", "The prompt might not adequately address the distinction between macro-level and micro-level truths. In Example 5, the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud might be true at a local level, even if it doesn't hold up when aggregated nationally. The prompt should recognize that some statements can be true within a specific context but not when generalized.", "The prompt may be too focused on the source of the information rather than the accuracy and context of the statement itself. In Example 7, the retired police captain's statement about law-enforcement officers dying 10 years earlier than the general population might be based on his extensive experience, making it a true statement despite not being widely documented in official records. The prompt should prioritize the accuracy and relevance of the statement over the source's reliability alone.", 'The prompt\'s definition of "real data" and "official records" might be too narrow, leading to misclassification. In Example 1, while Virginia being the biggest state without a major league sports team may seem subjective, it could still be considered a factual claim if supported by recent census data or sports league records, which the prompt does not explicitly consider reliable.', 'The prompt’s approach to verifying claims through reliable sources might be inconsistent or overly strict. In Example 2, the prediction "Yes" suggests a lack of verification from official sources like government reports or health care spending data, which might be necessary for accurate classification.', 'The prompt’s treatment of political statements and campaign rhetoric might be overly skeptical. In Example 7, the statement about eliminating the Department of Education in a campaign commercial should be classified based on the political context rather than its factual verifiability, which the prompt did not account for.', 'In Example 2, the statement about economic and social mobility is from a fundraising letter, which is typically aimed at soliciting donations rather than providing accurate statistical data. The prompt\'s focus on "official records" might lead it to overlook the nature of the source and incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a subjective claim meant to evoke a response rather than present verifiable facts.', 'Example 3 involves a campaign commercial, which is known for presenting claims that may not be fully substantiated. The prompt\'s criteria for classifying statements as true or false based on "evidence or official records" may not apply well to campaign advertisements, where the goal is often to persuade rather than provide accurate information. This can result in misclassification of the statement as false.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Congressman Nye voting against a bill is from his own website, which is a primary source for his actions and positions. However, the prompt might be too rigid in its requirement for "official records," leading it to miss the fact that Congressman Nye himself is the most authoritative source for his voting record, thus incorrectly labeling the statement as false.', 'Example 5 involves a statement made during a major foreign policy speech, which is a formal and public address. While the statement is attributed to a future President-Elect, the context suggests it is a policy position rather than a personal opinion. The prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations might lead it to incorrectly label the statement as false when it is actually a policy stance.', 'The prompt might be too rigid in its approach, failing to account for the complexity of political contexts where statements can be true but misleading depending on the audience or the issue at hand. For instance, statements about healthcare reform can be accurate even if some aspects of the implementation are controversial or misunderstood.', 'The prompt could be missing guidance on how to handle statements that are technically correct but incomplete or potentially misleading. For example, statements about minimum wages being low compared to other countries might be true, but the comparison should consider the overall economic context and living standards.', "The prompt does not specify how to handle statements from politicians who have changed their positions over time. It should include a consideration of the speaker's evolving stance and how that affects the truthfulness of their current statement.", 'The prompt lacks a clear method for verifying claims made by political figures, especially when those claims are part of a broader narrative or campaign. It should include instructions on cross-referencing claims with official documents, reliable media sources, and historical records to ensure the accuracy of the statement.', 'Lastly, the prompt does not address how to handle statements that are speculative or forward-looking. Examples like Example 5, where the statement claims a relative position among developed countries, require a different approach compared to statements that can be directly verified with current data. The prompt should include instructions on how to evaluate such statements, especially when they involve comparisons or projections.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Jews receiving notices in Ukraine is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently consider the historical context and the verifiability of such claims, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Obama and Bush bombing countries is a historical fact and should be labeled as true. The prompt might not properly weigh the credibility of the source or the historical accuracy of the claim, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 5 discusses campaign contributions from electric utilities, which is a factual claim that should be labeled as true. The prompt might not sufficiently prioritize the role and credibility of the speaker, especially in a political setting, which could result in an incorrect prediction.', 'The prompt may be getting these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the nature and context of the statement itself. For instance, in Example 1, the claim about cancer deaths being higher than 3,000 daily in the U.S. is likely an exaggeration or misinterpretation of statistics, but the statement is not inherently false without evidence. The prompt might be too quick to label such claims as lies without proper verification. It should encourage more nuanced evaluation rather than a binary yes/no decision.', 'In Example 2, the statement about halting EPA regulation helping stop rising gas prices could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex policy impacts. The prompt may not adequately handle such cases where the statement is a political oversimplification rather than a factual error. It should recognize that some statements, especially in political contexts, can be misleading without being outright false.', 'Example 3 involves a historical fact about the slave trade, which is a well-documented event with reliable historical records. The prompt’s failure to correctly identify this as a true statement suggests it may not prioritize established historical facts over other types of claims. Historical verifications should be a key part of the evaluation process.', 'Example 4 deals with a complex economic claim about corporate tax deductions, which requires a thorough understanding of tax laws and economic policies. The prompt may lack the depth needed to accurately assess such specialized information, leading to incorrect labeling. It should include a mechanism for verifying claims through expert knowledge or detailed research.', 'Examples like 5, 6, 7, and 8 involve statements made in informal contexts such as tweets, radio ads, and campaign websites. These statements often contain exaggerations, hyperbole, or misinformation that is common in such settings. The prompt may not adequately account for the typical inaccuracies or exaggerations found in these informal communications, leading to incorrect judgments. It should consider the medium and tone of the communication when evaluating the truthfulness of the statement.', 'The prompt may be too rigid in its approach, potentially overlooking the nuances in political statements where exaggeration or hyperbole is common. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about increasing spending by $12.5 billion might be seen as hyperbolic in a political context, which the model did not account for, leading to a misclassification.', "In Example 2, the statement about medication and abortion might be considered a matter of personal opinion rather than a clear lie, especially in a political debate setting. The model's strict criteria for determining a lie might not accommodate such complex and subjective topics, leading to incorrect classification.", 'Example 3 highlights the issue of insufficient context for accurate judgment. Without knowing the specific details of the memo and the actions taken after receiving it, classifying the statement as a lie might be premature. The model needs to better handle situations where there is limited information available.', 'In Example 4, the statement about isolated voter incidents might be seen as a general claim rather than a verifiable fact. Political rhetoric often includes generalizations that may not align with strict factual standards. The model should be more flexible in distinguishing between general claims and verifiable lies.', 'Example 5 showcases the challenge of verifying statements in a timely manner. By the time the statement was made, the relevant data may not yet be available or fully processed. The model should be aware of the time lag in verifying claims and avoid classifying statements as lies prematurely.', 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it overly relies on the context being explicitly labeled with job title, state, party, and other details, which are not always available or accurate. This rigidity can lead to misinterpretation or incorrect classification if some key information is missing or misunderstood.', 'The prompt might not account well for the nuance in language and the complexity of real-world situations. Statements can be misleading without being outright lies, such as in Example 4 where the term "flip-flopping" is often used politically to suggest change without providing context. The prompt needs to consider such subtleties to avoid over-simplifying the task.', "The prompt's criteria for determining a lie do not account for the nuance and complexity of political discourse. In Example 7, the statement about Pat Toomey advocating for the elimination of all corporate taxes is likely to be a simplification or exaggeration of his actual stance, but the prompt does not provide guidance on how to recognize and evaluate such simplifications in political rhetoric. This oversight leads to misclassification, as the prompt fails to consider the context and intent behind the statement.", "The prompt's reliance on the context of the statement, such as a fundraising letter or a press release, does not ensure a consistent approach to evaluating the truthfulness of the statement. In Example 8, the statement about the number of countries bombed by different presidents might be a simplified or misleading statistic, but the prompt does not provide a way to verify the accuracy of such claims in the context of a tweet. This lack of specificity in handling different types of contexts can lead to misclassification of statements that are actually truthful but presented in a misleading manner.", 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not clearly define what constitutes a "lie" in the context of political statements and personal narratives. Political statements often contain exaggerations and hyperbole that are common rhetorical devices, which the current prompt does not account for adequately. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about the American slave trade is factually accurate, but the prompt might not recognize this due to its strict definition of a lie. Similarly, the other examples involve statements that, while potentially exaggerated or misleading, are not necessarily lies in the strict sense intended by the prompt.', "The prompt's reliance on historical and factual background may lead to incorrect classifications if the necessary information is not readily available or if the background knowledge required to verify the statement is not provided. In Examples 3, 4, 5, and 7, the predictions were incorrect because the prompt did not consider the possibility that the statements, although potentially misleading, might be true based on unverified or unknown facts. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the complexity of political discourse.", 'Example 4 involves a statement about a drop-out rate in a congressional district, which is a specific and verifiable statistic. However, the prompt might not have considered the possibility that the statement could be an exaggeration or hyperbole common in political rhetoric. The prediction should take into account the rhetorical style and the likelihood of the claim being an accurate representation of reality, rather than just checking for numerical accuracy.', 'In Example 5, the statement about voting against a bill related to the IRS funding is a factual claim that can be verified through legislative records. The prompt might have missed the nuance that the statement is accurate but might be misleading due to the complexity of the issue. The prediction should consider both the literal truth of the statement and the broader implications of the action taken, rather than just the surface-level accuracy.', "The prompt could also be failing to recognize the nuance in political statements, particularly those made by politicians in a campaign setting. In Example 1, Jeff Merkley's statement about the Democratic National Convention discussing ISIS is a subjective opinion rather than a fact that needs to be directly verified. The prompt's rigid approach to fact-checking may overlook the possibility that such statements are more about perception and rhetoric than verifiable truth.", "In Example 6, the statement about medication in schools is a hyperbolic and potentially inflammatory claim that, while not factually accurate, might be more about the speaker's stance on a controversial issue rather than a straightforward lie. The prompt might need to account for the different types of claims and their implications, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation that considers the speaker's intent and the context of the statement.", "In Example 2, the statement comparing Obama and Bush's bombings is likely a hyperbolic or rhetorical claim rather than a factual assertion that needs to be strictly verified. The prompt should acknowledge that some statements are not meant to be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.", 'For Example 5, the statement about the Social Security system being broke might be a common misperception or a political argument rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt should differentiate between statements that are based on popular misinformation and those that are clearly false according to reliable sources.', 'Lastly, the prompt might struggle with statements that are partially true but exaggerated or misleading. For instance, in Example 5, the statement about Standard & Poor’s drop in the credit rating and the speaker’s position on the debt ceiling might be partially true but presented in a way that misrepresents the situation. The prompt needs to better account for the intent behind the statement and how it aligns with the facts, rather than just the verifiability of each component.', "In Example 2, the statement about new taxes on groceries is a relative claim that can be true or false depending on the specific policies proposed, but the prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie due to the advocacy group's job title, which could be biased.", 'Example 3 involves a sensitive and potentially controversial statement from a high-ranking law enforcement official. The prompt might not have correctly assessed the context and the potential for hyperbole or exaggeration in a campaign setting, leading to an incorrect prediction.', 'Example 4 is a straightforward pro-life statement by a U.S. senator, which is typically a clear and direct political stance. The prompt might have incorrectly labeled it as a lie because it did not recognize the common use of such declarative statements in political discourse.', 'In Examples 2 and 7, the statements are more about personal opinions or past actions rather than verifiable facts. The prompt\'s focus on absolute claims and the need to cross-reference with official documents or credible sources might not be appropriate for evaluating statements that are more about the speaker\'s intent or past behavior. Statements like "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill passed" are more about expectations and perceptions, which can be subjective and harder to prove definitively.', "Example 3 is a straightforward claim about political stances, which does not require complex verification but rather a simple comparison of the speaker's positions. The prompt's detailed approach to verifying claims might be too cumbersome for such simple and direct statements, leading to potential misclassifications.", "In Example 6, the statement comparing the number of illegal aliens in different states is likely to be incorrect due to the difficulty in obtaining precise and reliable data on illegal immigration. The prompt's insistence on needing absolute proof from official documents or credible sources might lead to an incorrect classification if the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven. The statement might be false due to the inaccuracy of the claim, but the process of verification could be challenging.", 'In Example 2, the statement about Governor McAuliffe’s desire to join the Clinton administration’s Cabinet is a relative claim about future intentions, which can be evaluated based on the context of a political figure expressing interest rather than an absolute fact needing immediate verification. The prompt may not have recognized the difference between such relative claims and absolute facts, leading to a misclassification.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about passing a bipartisan Medicaid bill, which might be a relative claim about legislative achievements rather than an absolute fact. The prompt likely failed to recognize that such claims can be true in the sense that they reflect the outcome of legislative efforts, even if the process was challenging.', 'In Example 4, the statement about deer baiting being illegal in Rhode Island is an absolute claim that requires immediate factual verification. However, the context provided (a commentary in a newspaper) might suggest that the claim is part of a broader discussion rather than a definitive fact. The prompt might not have adequately considered the nuances of different mediums and their typical usage.', 'Example 5 presents a statement about job creation in New Jersey, which is a relative claim about economic trends. The prompt might have incorrectly assumed that the statement needed absolute factual verification, failing to consider that such claims can be true in the context of overall job growth trends, even if they do not represent the peak employment levels.', 'The prompt’s reliance on "reliable sources" for classification might be too stringent in certain contexts, such as personal experiences or opinions expressed in campaign materials. For instance, a candidate might express a personal belief or intention that, while not verifiable at the moment, should still be considered in the context of the statement itself, rather than being dismissed outright due to lack of supporting data.', 'The prompt might not effectively distinguish between historical facts and current assertions. In cases like Example 1, where the statement refers to a historical fact (more people working in New Jersey), the prompt might overlook the potential for accurate historical claims that do not require ongoing verification through current data. The classification should take into account the nature of the statement and the time frame it pertains to.', 'The prompt lacks flexibility in handling different types of statements, particularly those that are aspirational or reflect personal experiences. In Example 7, the statement "I\'m pro-life. He\'s not" is a personal opinion and might not require external verification to be classified as true or false. The prompt’s strict criteria for evidence might not be suitable for evaluating such statements, leading to misclassification.', 'The prompt may have been too rigid in its approach to evaluating statements, leading to misclassification. It emphasizes verifying claims against official records and reliable sources but does not sufficiently account for the nature of the claim itself. For example, in Example 1, the statement about Joni Ernst’s promise to shut down government agencies is likely to be false or exaggerated, but the prompt’s focus on official records might not capture the hyperbolic nature of the claim effectively.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force is a significant claim that requires immediate verification due to its potential for causing public harm. The prompt’s focus on context and source reliability might have overlooked the urgency and potential for misinformation in such a statement.', 'Example 5 involves a statement from Jeff Greene about going to Cuba, which is more of a personal experience or aspiration rather than a factual claim requiring extensive verification. The prompt’s emphasis on factual claims and reliance on external sources might have led to an incorrect classification, overlooking the nature of the statement as a personal remark.', 'The prompt might not adequately distinguish between aspirational statements and factual claims. In Example 7, the statement about Governor McAuliffe wanting a Cabinet position is an aspirational statement rather than a factual claim. The prompt\'s focus on "verified by reliable sources" and "supported by real data" may not apply to such aspirational statements, leading to incorrect classification.', "The prompt might be incorrectly evaluating the examples because it overly relies on the need for verifiable facts and official documents, which can lead to false negatives for statements that are true but not easily verifiable. For instance, in Example 1, the statement about Kurt Schrader's vote could be true despite the lack of immediate access to official records, as the context suggests a plausible scenario given his position and the issue at hand.", 'In Example 2, the financial claim about the U.S. borrowing ratio might be accurate according to available data, even though the source is an email newsletter. The prompt’s emphasis on official documents or credible sources might cause it to miss this true statement.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies, which, while exaggerated, could still be true based on scientific evidence. The prompt’s focus on factual accuracy and reliable sources might overlook the validity of such a claim, leading to a false negative.', 'For Example 4, the statement about Senator Webb being reliable for Obama and Reid could be true based on observed voting patterns or other evidence, but the prompt’s prioritization of verifiable facts might result in a false negative.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage could be true based on the senator’s past votes or public record, but the prompt’s requirement for clear political party alignment might cause it to be labeled incorrectly.', "Example 3 highlights the issue of incomplete information. Without specific details about Joni Ernst's promises, the prompt might struggle to determine the veracity of the statement, especially if the promise is a common political rhetoric or a vague campaign pledge that is difficult to verify.", 'Example 4 involves a factual claim about concealed weapons permits. The prompt might prioritize checking against real data but fail to recognize that such claims can be true even if not widely known or reported, especially in specific states like Florida.', 'In Example 5, the statement about gay marriage is likely a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s emphasis on factual accuracy might not align well with evaluating statements about personal beliefs or opinions, which can vary widely and are less amenable to verification through official documents.', "Another reason could be that the prompt does not adequately account for the context in which statements are made. For example, in Example 1, the statement about George Allen’s U.S. senate candidacy is a job description and role clarification, which is generally considered accurate unless there's evidence to the contrary. Similarly, in Example 4, the statement about cigarette butts poisoning babies is a factual claim that can be easily verified against scientific literature, and the prediction should align with the actual verifiability of the claim.", 'The prompt lacks specific guidance on how to handle statements that are supported by multiple conflicting sources, as seen in Example 6. In such cases, the process of determining the truthfulness of the statement becomes more complex and requires a nuanced approach, which the current prompt does not adequately address.', 'The prompt’s focus on verifying statements against reliable sources might overlook the nuance of political discourse, where statements are often made in a broader context that includes ideological framing. For example, in Example 1, the statement about tax contributions by the top 1 percent is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of tax policy and economic data. The prompt should include guidance on how to interpret such statements within the broader context of political and economic discussions.', "The prompt's criteria for evaluating statements might be overly rigid, leading to misclassifications when dealing with nuanced or complex topics. In Example 2, the statement about biking in a crosswalk is based on a legal requirement that might not be explicitly stated but is part of the broader legal framework. The prompt should consider the possibility that some statements might be true even if specific data is not provided, particularly in contexts like legal regulations or common knowledge.", 'In Example 2, the statement about the health care law being found both constitutional and unconstitutional by different courts is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on legal precedents and official rulings. However, the model incorrectly labeled it as false, indicating that the prompt might not effectively distinguish between claims based on legal facts and those that could be subject to interpretation or multiple outcomes.', 'Example 3 highlights a situation where the statement about Florida leading the nation in prison inmates committing tax fraud is a specific claim that needs to be verified against accurate data. The model’s incorrect classification suggests that the prompt may not handle specialized areas like criminal statistics with the necessary granularity, potentially overlooking the need for detailed data analysis.', 'In Example 4, the statement about Charlie Crist breaking a record for fundraising is a factual claim that should be evaluated based on historical data. The model’s incorrect classification points to a lack of robust mechanisms within the prompt to cross-reference claims with verifiable records, especially when dealing with financial achievements that can be objectively measured.', 'Example 5 involves a comparative claim about the number of illegal aliens in Georgia versus Arizona, which requires precise demographic data to verify. The model’s incorrect classification indicates that the prompt might not effectively manage the complexity of comparing statistical data across regions, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated data handling and cross-referencing capabilities.', "The prompt could be missing specific guidance on how to handle claims made by individuals in their roles, such as in Example 4, where Charlie Crist's statement about breaking a record is more likely to be based on internal campaign data rather than public records. This context-specific nuance is important for accurate classification.", 'In Example 5, the statement made by Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. in a campaign TV ad might be seen as a direct recommendation rather than a factual claim, which could warrant a "No" label. The prompt might benefit from a clearer distinction between recommendations and factual statements.', 'The prompt’s criteria for evaluating statements might not adequately consider the intent behind the communication, such as in Example 7, where the Secretary of State’s statement is part of a political debate and not necessarily meant to be taken as a literal fact. The context of the statement as part of a broader discussion might affect its classification.', 'In Example 2, the statement about Jeff Vanderbeek taking the state into arbitration is likely to be a factual claim about a legal action, which should be evaluated based on the credibility of the source and any legal records, not just the context of a news conference. The prompt needs to clarify that some claims, especially those involving legal actions, should be verified through official records rather than the medium of communication.', 'Example 3 involves a statement about the unemployment insurance trust fund, which requires specific financial data to verify. The prompt should emphasize the importance of checking such claims against official government reports or audits, rather than relying solely on the context of an interview. This would help avoid misclassifying claims based on incomplete or outdated data.', 'In Example 4, the statement about one-third of automobile fatalities being due to alcohol is a statistical claim that requires verification from reliable sources like traffic safety reports or studies. The prompt should instruct evaluators to look for such corroborating data before classifying the statement as unsupported, especially when dealing with statistics.', 'Example 5 involves a false claim about Obama putting a 10% tax on tanning, which is clearly a fabricated statement. The prompt should include specific instructions to identify and flag such false or misleading claims, even if they come from a non-traditional source like a TV commercial or reality show. This ensures that false statements are correctly identified regardless of their origin.', "The prompt's criteria for evaluating claims based on evidence might not fully capture the nuance of certain statements, such as those made in media or social media. In Example 7, the statement about MSNBC's response to the Ferguson incident is more about the media's reaction and internal processes, which might not fit neatly into the categories of factual claims or personal experiences. The prompt’s reliance on evidence and official records might not be suitable for evaluating such subjective claims.", "The prompt's criteria for evaluating claims do not sufficiently differentiate between types of sources and their reliability. In Example 6, the statement about Lee Zeldin missing hearings is based on a tweet and a Newsday article, which might not be considered reliable enough for factual verification. The prompt should consider the credibility of the sources more carefully, especially in cases where the statement is made by a candidate for Congress.", 'The prompt may have gotten these examples wrong because it does not sufficiently account for the specific context and nuances of political rhetoric and media releases. For instance, in Example 2, the statement about Betty Sutton voting to destroy Medicare might be misleading if it is taken out of context or if the term "destroy" is used in a hyperbolic way. The prompt needs to better handle such cases where the intent and context of the statement are crucial.', 'In Example 3, the statement about the federal tax code having loopholes that incentivize job shipping overseas could be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, especially when made by a political figure. The prompt should allow for such possibilities and not automatically label such statements as false without sufficient contradictory evidence.', 'Example 4 involves a statement about President Obama owning a significant portion of General Motors (GM). This could be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of facts, possibly due to the complexity of ownership structures in large corporations. The prompt should consider the potential for such exaggerations and hyperboles in political rhetoric.', 'In Example 5, the statement about the unemployment insurance trust fund being broke and in debt could be a simplification or misrepresentation of complex financial situations. The prompt should acknowledge that such statements might be based on simplified or misleading representations rather than strict factual inaccuracies.', 'Example 6 involves a statement about position eliminations, which could be a comparison made in a way that misrepresents the scale of reductions. The prompt should consider the potential for such comparisons to be misleading or exaggerated, especially when made by someone in a leadership position.', 'The prompt does not adequately account for the complexity of evaluating claims made by different types of sources, such as op-ed columns or TV ads, which require a different level of scrutiny depending on their nature. For instance, an op-ed column might contain more subjective commentary, while a TV ad is more focused on persuasive messaging, and these differences should influence the classification.', "The prompt’s evaluation criteria do not sufficiently account for the nuances of political discourse, where statements might be made for rhetorical effect or to convey a broader message. In Examples 3 and 7, the statements about Rep. John Katko's voting record and Sharron Angle's proposed elimination of the Department of Education are aspirational statements meant to criticize the opposition rather than factual claims. The prompt might be too literal in its interpretation, classifying these as lies when they are more accurately described as political rhetoric.", 'The prompt lacks clarity on how to handle statements that are difficult to verify due to the nature of the claim itself, such as historical claims or claims about past actions. For instance, the statement "Obama has never visited Israel" requires a thorough investigation into Obama\'s travel history, which might be challenging to confirm definitively. The examples show that the prompt did not consider the difficulty in verifying some claims, leading to incorrect classifications.', 'The prompt does not provide clear guidelines on how to handle statements that are based on subjective experiences or opinions, even if they are presented as factual. For example, the statement "Republicans will own 60% of GM" is more of an opinion or prediction rather than a factual claim that can be easily verified. The examples suggest that the prompt may have incorrectly classified such statements as false because it did not differentiate between factual claims and subjective opinions.', 'Example 3 highlights the issue of verifying claims against specific evidence. The statement about Lee Zeldin missing two-thirds of Veterans Affairs Hearings is likely to be supported by a specific record or report. The prompt should ensure that the classification is based on the availability and reliability of such evidence, rather than a general assumption that political claims are exaggerated. The "Yes" label here indicates that the claim is backed by a verifiable source, which the model incorrectly classified as "No".', 'Example 5 demonstrates the challenge of distinguishing between factual claims and aspirational statements. Jeff Vanderbeek taking the New Jersey Devils into arbitration might be a factual claim supported by legal documents, making it a "No" classification. The model’s "Yes" prediction indicates that it might be conflating aspirational claims with factual ones. The prompt should clarify that while aspirational statements might not be strictly factual, they should still be evaluated based on their verifiability and context, ensuring that they are labeled accurately.', 'The prompt overly emphasizes the need for statements to be supported by real data, official records, or verified by reliable sources, which can lead to misclassification of aspirational or speculative statements as lies. Statements like "We have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years" and "Says in 1944 we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now" are examples where the context and intent might be about future aspirations or historical claims that are not easily verifiable at the time of the statement, yet they are classified as lies due to lack of concrete evidence.', 'In Example 3, the statement about Barack Obama playing golf is a factual claim that can be verified through public records or media reports, making it a "No" classification. However, the prompt incorrectly labels it as "Yes" due to the lack of direct data or official records. This highlights the need for the prompt to better distinguish between aspirational or speculative statements and factual claims that can be substantiated.', 'Another issue is the prompt\'s reliance on the context and specific details provided, which can sometimes lead to misinterpretation. In Example 2, the context is from a promotional video for "Jersey Shore," which is entertainment content, and the statement itself is hyperbolic and likely false. However, the prompt\'s detailed evaluation process might have overlooked the entertainment context, leading to a misclassification.', "The prompt does not adequately account for the role of job titles and the context in which statements are made. In Examples 2 and 8, the statements are made by individuals in positions where they have the authority to make such claims, and the context supports the plausibility of their statements. The prompt's rigid approach to requiring verifiable data might overlook the credibility of statements made by authoritative figures.", "The prompt's evaluation process might not fully capture the complexity of statements made by columnists or authors, who often express opinions or make claims based on analysis or interpretation rather than concrete data. In Examples 2 and 8, the statements are from columnists and authors, whose work is more interpretive and less tied to verifiable data. The prompt's reliance on official records and verifiable data might not appropriately evaluate the truthfulness of such statements, leading to misclassifications.", 'The prompt’s approach to evaluating aspirational or personal statements might not sufficiently consider the speaker\'s authority or the context in which the statement is made. For example, in Example 3, the mayor of Chicago\'s claim about gun control might be aspirational but is still relevant to his role and should be evaluated based on its context and the likelihood of its fulfillment, rather than strict factual verification. The prompt’s rigid criteria for "No" classification might miss the relevance and potential truth of such statements in the context of a political leader addressing public safety.', 'The prompt’s criteria for classifying statements as "No" might not adequately consider the speaker\'s party affiliation and the context of the statement, especially when the statement is a criticism of another party. In Example 8, the statement about Mitt Romney flip-flopping on abortion is a political critique rather than a verifiable fact. The prompt’s strict criteria for requiring strong evidence from reliable sources might lead to misclassification, as the statement is more about political strategy and perception than verifiable truth.'] items,

Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and other information. For each statement, consider the reliability of the claim, available data, and the source of the information. If the statement is supported by real data, official records, or credible sources, classify it as "No". If the statement is unsupported by evidence, contradicts available data, or is presented in a misleading manner, classify it as "Yes". Pay close attention to the context, job title, and the nature of the source (e.g., official statements, reputable news outlets, personal opinions). Differentiate between factual claims and personal experiences or speculations. For political figures, consider their official platforms and records as primary sources. For advertisements or campaigns, evaluate the claims based on their intent and the context of persuasion rather than strict factual verification. Use reliable sources to verify the accuracy of claims, but recognize that political rhetoric may include exaggerations or hyperbole. Consider the possibility that claims can be true based on historical or anecdotal evidence, especially for political figures or candidates expressing personal beliefs or intentions. Account for the time lag in verifying claims and avoid premature classification. Acknowledge that some statements are hyperbolic or rhetorical and should not be taken at face value but rather as expressions of opinion or exaggeration.

Additionally, consider the specificity of the job titles and roles. Statements from individuals in authoritative positions, such as governors or sheriffs, should be evaluated with higher scrutiny due to the potential impact of their statements. For example, a Governor of New Jersey making a statement about tenure laws or a Milwaukee County Sheriff advising citizens to use lethal force should be verified immediately and thoroughly, given the potential public safety implications.

Recognize the distinction between absolute and relative statements. A statement about the number of Democratic state senators supporting a bill might be factually incorrect but still reflect a true relative change in support over time. Evaluate such claims by considering the context and any relevant historical data.

When dealing with media or social media statements, consider the nature of the claim and the medium. Statements about media reactions, such as an MSNBC response to an event, may require different criteria for evaluation, focusing more on the context and the media's typical behavior rather than strict factual verification.

Urgent and potentially harmful claims, such as advice to use lethal force, should be classified with high priority and immediate verification, even if they do not align with the standard criteria for factual verification.
