  prompt: # Task
**Task:**  
Decide if a given headline or short passage is clickbait. Use a conditional, step‑by‑step process that adapts to the type of content and the tone it employs.

---

### 1. Identify the Domain & Tone  
- **News** – mentions a public event, official statement, or factual report.  
- **Entertainment/Marketing** – focuses on pop culture, lifestyle, health tips, or promotional material.  
- **Education/Puzzle** – presents a question, riddle, or learning prompt.  

Write down the domain you’ve chosen; it will guide the next steps.

---

### 2. Scan for Surface‑Level Signals  
- Look for excessive punctuation (!!!, …), all‑caps words, or hyperbolic adjectives (“the best”, “you’ll never believe”).  
- If any of these are present, label the piece as **Potential Clickbait**; otherwise, move to the next stage.

---

### 3. Examine Content & Context  
- **Education/Puzzle**: A clear, fact‑answerable question (e.g., “Can you identify these pop artists by an anagram?”) → **Non‑Clickbait**.  
- **News/Politics**: A question or exclamation that states a fact without sensational framing (e.g., “Iraq on verge of…”) → **Non‑Clickbait**.  
- **Entertainment/Marketing**: A question or exclamation lacking a factual basis (e.g., “Up your breakfast game with these hacks”) → **Clickbait**.

---

### 4. Resolve Ambiguity with a Scoring Rubric  
| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No clickbait cues at all. |
| 2 | Minor sensational language, overall factual. |
| 3 | Mixed signals, unclear intent. |
| 4 | Strong clickbait traits but some factual content. |
| 5 | Clear, deliberate clickbait. |

- If surface cues are present **and** factual detail is also provided, give **3 or 4**.  
- If it relies only on sensational cues, give **5**.

When unsure, choose the lower end of the scale and record your reasoning.

---

### 5. Practical Tips  
- Don’t judge solely on capitalization or punctuation; consider the whole context.  
- High‑frequency clickbait words (“discover”, “secret”) are not automatically clickbait if the piece is genuinely informative.  
- In urgent news or political contexts, differentiate urgency from clickbait.  
- For ambiguous texts, err on the side of caution and explain the uncertainty.

---

**Deliverable:**  
Follow the above structure to produce a consistent, nuanced classification for each headline or brief text you evaluate. Include the domain label, any surface‑level flags, the final classification (Non‑Clickbait / Clickbait / Potential Clickbait) and, if scored, the numeric value with a brief justification.

**Task:**  
Decide if the given headline or short paragraph is click‑bait. Use a step‑by‑step, conditional method that adapts to the type of content and its style.

---

### Step 1 – Identify the domain and tone  
| Domain | What to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| **News** | Mentions of a current event, official statement, or factual report. |
| **Entertainment/Marketing** | Topics on pop culture, wellness, lifestyle, or promotional material. |
| **Education/Puzzle** | Puzzles, riddles, quizzes, or instructional prompts. |

*Keep the identified domain in mind for the next steps.*

---

### Step 2 – Scan for surface‑level red flags  
*If any of the following appear, mark the piece as **Potential Click‑bait** and jump to Step 4. Otherwise, continue to Step 3.*

- Over‑use of punctuation (!!!, …)
- All‑caps words
- Hyperbolic adjectives (“the best”, “you’ll never believe”, etc.)

---

### Step 3 – Evaluate the core content and context  

| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Headline is a clear, answerable question **and** the domain is *Education/Puzzle* | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *News* or *Politics*, presenting a factual claim without sensational framing | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *Entertainment/Marketing*, lacking a clear factual basis | **Click‑bait** |

---

### Step 4 – Resolve uncertainty with a score (1 – 5)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No click‑bait elements at all |
| 2 | Minor sensational language, overall factual |
| 3 | Ambiguous intent, mixed signals |
| 4 | Strong click‑bait cues but some factual content |
| 5 | Clear, deliberate click‑bait |

*If Step 2 flagged potential click‑bait but factual detail is present, choose 3 or 4. If the text relies solely on sensational cues, choose 5.*

---

### Tips & Cautions  
- Don’t base the decision only on capitalization or punctuation; consider overall context and domain.  
- Avoid over‑labeling headlines that use common click‑bait words (e.g., “discover”, “secret”) when they belong to legitimate information pieces.  
- For political or breaking‑news content, treat urgency carefully—urgency alone isn’t click‑bait.  
- When ambiguous, lean toward a lower score and explain the uncertainty in your reasoning.

**Follow this structure to produce a consistent, nuanced classification for each input.**

**Task**  
Determine whether the supplied text is clickbait and give a brief justification.

**Procedure**  
1. Identify the text’s domain or genre (e.g., news, entertainment, marketing). If it’s not clear, treat it as general media.  
2. Look for common clickbait markers:  
   * Excessive or sensational punctuation,  
   * All‑caps wording,  
   * Phrases such as “you won’t believe,” “shocking,” “must see,” or promises of hidden revelations.  
3. If any of these cues appear, evaluate whether the headline uses a curiosity‑driven hook without providing concrete information or offers an exaggerated payoff.  
4. If the statement is straightforward and lacks a sensational hook, classify it as non‑clickbait.  
5. Take context into account: political or urgent news may use strong language but isn’t necessarily clickbait; marketing copy may be sensational yet not manipulative if it directly advertises a product.  
6. When uncertainty persists, default to “No” unless the headline clearly seeks to manipulate curiosity.  

**Answer Format**  
Return a single word, “Yes” or “No,” followed by one sentence explaining the decision. Avoid relying solely on capitalization or punctuation; instead focus on the intent to attract attention. If the text contains high‑frequency clickbait words but lacks emotional or curiosity‑driven content, classify it as non‑clickbait.

**Task:**  
Decide if the given headline or short paragraph is click‑bait. Use a step‑by‑step, conditional method that adapts to the type of content and its style.

---

### Step 1 – Identify the domain and tone  
| Domain | What to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| **News** | Mentions of a current event, official statement, or factual report. |
| **Entertainment/Marketing** | Topics on pop culture, wellness, lifestyle, or promotional material. |
| **Education/Puzzle** | Puzzles, riddles, quizzes, or instructional prompts. |

*Keep the identified domain in mind for the next steps.*

---

### Step 2 – Scan for surface‑level red flags  
*If any of the following appear, mark the piece as **Potential Click‑bait** and jump to Step 4. Otherwise, continue to Step 3.*

- Over‑use of punctuation (!!!, …)
- All‑caps words
- Hyperbolic adjectives (“the best”, “you’ll never believe”, etc.)

---

### Step 3 – Evaluate the core content and context  

| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Headline is a clear, answerable question **and** the domain is *Education/Puzzle* | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *News* or *Politics*, presenting a factual claim without sensational framing | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *Entertainment/Marketing*, lacking a clear factual basis | **Click‑bait** |

---

### Step 4 – Resolve uncertainty with a score (1 – 5)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No click‑bait elements at all |
| 2 | Minor sensational language, overall factual |
| 3 | Ambiguous intent, mixed signals |
| 4 | Strong click‑bait cues but some factual content |
| 5 | Clear, deliberate click‑bait |

*If Step 2 flagged potential click‑bait but factual detail is present, choose 3 or 4. If the text relies solely on sensational cues, choose 5.*

---

### Tips & Cautions  
- Don’t base the decision only on capitalization or punctuation; consider overall context and domain.  
- Avoid over‑labeling headlines that use common click‑bait words (e.g., “discover”, “secret”) when they belong to legitimate information pieces.  
- For political or breaking‑news content, treat urgency carefully—urgency alone isn’t click‑bait.  
- When ambiguous, lean toward a lower score and explain the uncertainty in your reasoning.

  prompt: # Task
**Task:**  
Decide if the given headline or short paragraph is click‑bait. Use a step‑by‑step, conditional method that adapts to the type of content and its style.

---

### Step 1 – Identify the domain and tone  
| Domain | What to look for |
|--------|------------------|
| **News** | Mentions of a current event, official statement, or factual report. |
| **Entertainment/Marketing** | Topics on pop culture, wellness, lifestyle, or promotional material. |
| **Education/Puzzle** | Puzzles, riddles, quizzes, or instructional prompts. |

*Keep the identified domain in mind for the next steps.*

---

### Step 2 – Scan for surface‑level red flags  
*If any of the following appear, mark the piece as **Potential Click‑bait** and jump to Step 4. Otherwise, continue to Step 3.*

- Over‑use of punctuation (!!!, …)
- All‑caps words
- Hyperbolic adjectives (“the best”, “you’ll never believe”, etc.)

---

### Step 3 – Evaluate the core content and context  

| Situation | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Headline is a clear, answerable question **and** the domain is *Education/Puzzle* | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *News* or *Politics*, presenting a factual claim without sensational framing | **Non‑Click‑bait** |
| Headline is a question or exclamation **and** the domain is *Entertainment/Marketing*, lacking a clear factual basis | **Click‑bait** |

---

### Step 4 – Resolve uncertainty with a score (1 – 5)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No click‑bait elements at all |
| 2 | Minor sensational language, overall factual |
| 3 | Ambiguous intent, mixed signals |
| 4 | Strong click‑bait cues but some factual content |
| 5 | Clear, deliberate click‑bait |

*If Step 2 flagged potential click‑bait but factual detail is present, choose 3 or 4. If the text relies solely on sensational cues, choose 5.*

---

### Tips & Cautions  
- Don’t base the decision only on capitalization or punctuation; consider overall context and domain.  
- Avoid over‑labeling headlines that use common click‑bait words (e.g., “discover”, “secret”) when they belong to legitimate information pieces.  
- For political or breaking‑news content, treat urgency carefully—urgency alone isn’t click‑bait.  
- When ambiguous, lean toward a lower score and explain the uncertainty in your reasoning.
