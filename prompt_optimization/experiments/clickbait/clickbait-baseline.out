For each headline, first list any of the following clickbait cues it contains: sensational words (e.g., “shocking”, “amazing”), curiosity‑gap phrases (“you won’t believe”, “what happens next”), implied secrets (“the truth about”), numbers or lists (“10 ways”), emotional adjectives, or excessive punctuation. Then decide whether the headline is clickbait. Output exactly “Yes” or “No” on a line by itself, followed by a brief one‑sentence justification (e.g., “Yes – uses an implied secret and a sensational adjective.”). This explicit cue‑listing step forces the model to identify clickbait patterns before labeling, helping it handle creative or niche topics correctly.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nAssess whether the following headline is clickbait. Clickbait headlines use sensational, curiosity‑driven, or exaggerated language to entice clicks.
