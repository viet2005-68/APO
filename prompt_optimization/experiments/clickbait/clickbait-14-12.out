### Contextual Signals:
- **Newsworthy or emotionally significant events**, even if phrased neutrally, may still be clickbait if framed to **capitalize on public interest** or **emotional resonance** (e.g., major disasters, humanitarian efforts, political statements).
- **Language that subtly implies a transformation, benefit, or revelation**, even without strong emotional or playful language (e.g., "How the Paris Attacks changed global politics" may still be clickbait if framed to attract clicks through newsworthiness).

Be especially sensitive to:
- **Playful or aspirational language** that implies a benefit or transformation (e.g., "up your game," "boost your mood," "change your life").
- **Emotional weight** or **public interest** that may be used to drive traffic, even without overt clickbait phrases.

**Improved Zero-Shot Prompt for Clickbait Classification:**

Classify the given text as either **"Yes" (clickbait)** or **"No" (not clickbait)** by evaluating whether it is designed to **attract clicks** using either **explicit linguistic cues** or **contextual factors** that exploit public interest, emotional resonance, or newsworthiness.

Consider both **explicit features** and **contextual signals**:

### Explicit Features:
- **Intriguing questions** that encourage curiosity or reflection (e.g., "What if...?", "How many...?")
- **Expressions that are engaging, relatable, or playful** and invite the reader to interact (e.g., "Have you ever...?", "You won’t believe...?", "Up your game", "Make your day better")
- **Numerical or list-based phrasing**, even when presented in a casual or humorous tone (e.g., "10 things you didn’t know...", "How many...?")
- **Mysterious or compelling language** that suggests a hidden story or revelation (e.g., "The secret behind...", "What really happened...")
- **References to pop culture, celebrities, or current events**, especially those used to create surprise or a sense of exclusivity (e.g., "Emilia Clarke was named...", "Only a few know...")
- **Language that suggests exclusivity, insider knowledge, or unexpected information** (e.g., "The truth nobody tells you...", "Only 10% know...")

### Contextual Signals:
- **Newsworthy or emotionally significant events**, even if phrased neutrally, may still be clickbait if framed to **capitalize on public interest** or **emotional resonance** (e.g., major disasters, humanitarian efforts, political statements).
- **Language that subtly implies a transformation, benefit, or revelation**, even without strong emotional or playful language (e.g., "How the Paris Attacks changed global politics" may still be clickbait if framed to attract clicks through newsworthiness).

Be especially sensitive to:
- **Playful or aspirational language** that implies a benefit or transformation (e.g., "up your game," "boost your mood," "change your life").
- **Emotional weight** or **public interest** that may be used to drive traffic, even without overt clickbait phrases.
