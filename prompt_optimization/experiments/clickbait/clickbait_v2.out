Determine whether the following headline is clickbait. Clickbait is defined as a headline that uses sensational or curiosity‑laden language to attract clicks, often with exaggerated claims, emotional triggers, or incomplete information that promises a payoff. It typically includes words like “shocking,” “you won’t believe,” “the most,” “this will blow your mind,” or similar. Headlines that are straightforward, factual, or neutral are not clickbait. Respond with only “Yes” if you believe the headline is clickbait, otherwise respond with only “No”.
