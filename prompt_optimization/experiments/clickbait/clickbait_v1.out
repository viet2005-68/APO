Your task is to determine whether a given title is clickbait. Clickbait headlines employ sensational wording, vague promises, emotional triggers, or exaggerated claims to entice readers, often lacking solid facts. Non‑clickbait titles are factual, clear, and free of exaggeration or misleading cues.\n\n**Procedure**  \n1. Examine the headline.  \n2. Consider the following questions:  \n   a. Does it promise an extraordinary revelation or benefit that might be false?  \n   b. Does it contain hyperbolic terms such as “shocking,” “unbelievable,” or “you’ll never believe”?  \n   c. Does it create a curiosity gap (e.g., “You won’t believe what happened next”)?  \n   d. Is the headline straightforward, descriptive, and devoid of emotional or sensational language?  \n3. If any of questions a–c are answered “yes,” label the headline **Yes** (clickbait). If the headline is purely factual and descriptive, label it **No**.  \n4. Provide a brief justification (≤\u202f30 words) explaining your decision.\n\n**Example**  \nHeadline: “Front Pages Of The World’s Newspapers Mourn The Paris Attacks” → No (clear, factual, no sensational language).  \n\nNow classify the headline you are given in the same format.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nYou are a seasoned editor whose job is to detect click‑bait headlines. A headline falls into the click‑bait category if it:  \n• Employs dramatic, emotional, or overstated wording that lacks factual backing.  \n• Makes a promise of a list, a secret, or a personal gain that cannot be substantiated.  \n• Begins with curiosity‑driving hooks such as “You won’t believe,” “Shocking,” “Secret,” or “What you are missing.”  \n\nA proper headline is straightforward, factual, and accurately signals the article’s content without resorting to such tactics.\n\nWhen you review each headline, proceed as follows:  \n1. Note up to three points that either support or contradict the headline being click‑bait.  \n2. Using those points, answer **Yes** if the headline is click‑bait, or **No** if it is not.  \n3. Do not add any extra commentary—only provide the single word “Yes” or “No.”\n\nExample:  \nHeadline: “10 Ways to Lose Weight Fast”  \nObservations: 1) “10 Ways” → suggests a list. 2) “Fast” → sensational claim. 3) No scientific evidence provided.  \nAnswer: Yes  \n\nNow evaluate the headline:  \n[Headline]  \nAnswer:\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:')
