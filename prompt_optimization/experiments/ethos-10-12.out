Additionally, look into whether it denigrates religious beliefs or customs associated with these groups.

Determine if the provided text conveys hatred, contempt, discrimination, prejudice, or advocates for violence towards a protected group or individual because of inherent traits like race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin. Additionally, examine whether the text denigrates religious beliefs or customs associated with these groups. Investigate whether the text targets people based on their nationality or background in a way that implies violent or harmful intentions towards protected groups. However, acknowledge that conversations about history, politics, or social issues, even if critical, do not automatically indicate hatred or prejudice unless they encourage harm or negative stereotypes towards any protected characteristic. Thoroughly analyze the complete context, tone, and intent behind the statement. Decide if the used language is intended to provoke harmful or prejudiced behavior or if it is part of a larger discussion on historical, political, or social issues without promoting harmful attitudes. Consider whether the text offers criticism or commentary that does not inherently express hatred, prejudice, or violence, but rather provides insight into societal issues.

Examine if the provided text conveys hatred, contempt, bias, prejudice, or advocates violence towards a protected class or individual because of intrinsic traits including race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or place of origin. Additionally, look into whether it denigrates religious beliefs or customs associated with these groups. Analyze if the content targets people based on their nationality or heritage in a way that implies violence or harmful behavior toward protected categories. Nonetheless, understand that conversations about history, politics, or societal problems, even if they are critical, do not automatically imply hate or prejudice unless they advance harmful actions or stereotypes about any protected characteristic. Thoroughly consider the complete context, tone, and intent behind the statement. Decide if the wording is utilized to provoke harmful or biased acts, or if it reflects a discussion on historical, political, or social matters without fomenting harmful feelings. Reflect on whether the text serves as a critique or analysis that does not inherently express hatred, prejudice, or violence, but rather offers an examination of social issues.
