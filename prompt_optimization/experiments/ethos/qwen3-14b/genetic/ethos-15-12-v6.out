Classify the given text as either **"Hate Speech"** or **"Not Hate Speech"** based on **whether the text directly or indirectly attacks or devalues an individual or group based on protected characteristics** such as race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, or other similar attributes.

When making your classification, consider the following:

- **Targeting**: Is the statement directed at a specific **group or individual** based on one or more **protected characteristics**? General complaints, fears, or discomfort with behavior that does not reference identity or protected attributes do **not** constitute hate speech.
- **Intent**: Does the speaker express **hatred, contempt, dehumanization, or encouragement of violence** against a specific group or individual?
- **Language**: Are there **slurs, derogatory terms, or repeated expressions of disdain** aimed at a protected group or individual?
- **Context and Tone**: Is the statement **contextually or tonally** directed at a group or individual in a way that reflects **bias or hostility**?

Do **not** classify as hate speech:
- General expressions of **discomfort, fear, or dislike** of **behavior or appearance**, unless tied to a protected group.
- Criticisms of **ideas or policies**, not people or groups.
- Language that is **not clearly aimed at a protected group** or **does not express hatred or dehumanization**.
- **Political or geopolitical criticism**, even if it involves violence or dehumanizing language, **unless it explicitly targets individuals or groups based on protected attributes** and expresses hatred or dehumanization.

**Examples:**
- "Anti-LGBT people, How sad and ignorant...I can't believe it...How how ??? can they not see how STUPID they are?????" → **Hate Speech** (targets a protected group with offensive and derogatory language)
- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that’s disgraceful." → **Not Hate Speech** (targets behavior, not a protected attribute)
- "Easter is the most silly holiday ever existed. It must be stopped. Shame shame shame." → **Hate Speech** (expresses contempt toward a religious group)
- "Deport him in military aircraft and dump him back where he is originated from. Him and his family." → **Hate Speech** (calls for violence and dehumanizes individuals based on origin)
- "Huh kids like this with crazy eyes and weird moves lurking around are scary. Please mama of this creeper cuff him and sent him to an asylum" → **Not Hate Speech** (expresses fear or discomfort, but does not clearly target a protected group)
- "Id beat the fuck out of his ass if he wasnt an actor" → **Not Hate Speech** (expresses aggression, but not based on protected attributes)
- "Humiliating this Str8 guy. str8 guys like him doing dumb things" → **Not Hate Speech** (targets behavior and identity, but lacks clear dehumanization or hate)
- "Dalit? Is this a name of religion or an atom of poo composition" → **Hate Speech** (uses derogatory language and dehumanizes a group based on caste, which is a protected characteristic in many contexts)

**Additional Clarification for Political or Geopolitical Contexts:**
- Statements that describe **state-sponsored violence**, **group-based persecution**, or **systemic oppression** should still be evaluated based on **whether the language used expresses hatred, dehumanization, or violence toward individuals or groups based on protected characteristics**, not just based on the **political context**.
- Example: "seen the way the israelis treat the palestinians? slaughter on a weekly basis, very racist are the israelis to the point of genocide." → **Not Hate Speech** (describes political conflict or state violence, but does not express hatred or dehumanization toward a specific **group** in a **personalized or targeted** way)
- Example: "Should have been sterilised upon arrival. Now your future doesn't exist." → **Not Hate Speech** (expresses a harsh opinion but does not clearly target a **protected group** with **hatred or dehumanization**)
- Example: "its a good thing im not a commander or so in the police force,specially not during something like this,because the jail would be full of ppl waiting to be deported,if not dead" → **Hate Speech** (expresses dehumanizing rhetoric and calls for violence, targeting individuals based on **national origin**)

Be **specific and cautious** in your classification—only label as hate speech when a **protected group or individual is clearly targeted with hatred, contempt, or dehumanization**, and the **language is not merely political critique or geopolitical commentary**.
