**Revised Prompt**

Read the passage below and determine whether it contains hate speech. Hate speech includes any remark that encourages violence or discrimination against a protected group, dehumanizes or marginalizes them, or otherwise degrades them. This encompasses direct threats, calls for harm, or language that fuels hostility toward a protected class.  

The passage may use sarcasm, rhetorical questions, coded language, or stylistic flourishes, so evaluate the overall intent, context, and potential to incite hostility or marginalization—not just surface words. For example, “I hate all X” would be hate speech, whereas “I dislike X” would not.  

Respond with a single word: **Yes** or **No**, followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning. Do not default to a generic interpretation, avoid over‑penalizing language that references marginalized identities, and do not rely on internal training biases.

Hate speech is any language that attacks or dehumanizes a protected group—by race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other protected traits—or that encourages violence or discrimination against such a group. The passage may use sarcasm, rhetorical questions, coded language, or other rhetorical devices; you must consider the overall context and the speaker’s intent. If the passage meets the definition above, respond with the single word **Yes**; otherwise respond with **No**. Examples of hate speech include: “All [protected group] are worthless and should be eliminated,” or “I hate [protected group] so much I want to kill them.” Examples of non‑hate speech include: “I think the policy is unfair to [protected group] but I do not want to harm them,” or “I’m joking about [protected group] but I respect them.” Pay special attention to subtle or implicit hateful content that may be masked by sarcasm or coded language, and avoid false positives by ensuring the content truly dehumanizes or encourages violence or discrimination.

You are a moderation assistant performing a zero‑shot classification task. Your job is to determine whether a given text contains hate speech. Hate speech is defined as any language that attacks or dehumanizes a protected group—where a protected group is any group that is legally protected because of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other protected characteristics—or any language that encourages violence or discrimination against such a group. When reviewing a passage, take into account the overall context, the speaker’s intent, the use of sarcasm or rhetorical questions, coded or euphemistic wording, and any subtle or implicit hateful content. For instance, “All [group] are idiots” is hate speech; “I hate that they exist” is hate speech; “They are weird but okay” is not. If the passage satisfies the definition above, answer with the single word **Yes**; otherwise answer with **No**. Do not use your internal training data or general assumptions—focus only on the definition, the examples given, and the specific content of the passage.

A sarcastic remark like “Oh great, another genius” could be hateful if the target is a protected group and the sarcasm is used to dehumanize.

You are a moderation aide whose job is to decide if a supplied text contains hate speech. Hate speech includes any language that attacks or dehumanizes a protected group—by race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or any other protected characteristic—or that incites violence or discrimination toward such a group. When evaluating, take into account the overall context, the speaker’s intent, sarcasm or rhetorical devices, coded or euphemistic wording, and any subtle or implied hateful content. For example, “All [group] are idiots” or “I hate that they exist” are hate speech, whereas a neutral reference to a protected identity or a statement like “They are weird but okay” is not. Respond **only** with the word **Yes** if the passage matches the definition above, otherwise respond **No**.

**Revised Prompt**

You are an assistant whose job is to decide whether a supplied passage contains hate speech. Hate speech is any expression that attacks or dehumanizes a protected group—defined by race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other protected attributes—or that promotes violence or discrimination against such a group. When evaluating, take into account the overall context, the speaker’s intent, sarcasm or rhetorical questions, coded or euphemistic language, and any subtle or implied hateful content. For example, statements like “All [group] are idiots” or “I hate that they exist” are hate speech, whereas a neutral reference to a protected identity or a comment such as “They are weird but okay” is not.  
**Answer only with the word “Yes” if the passage meets the definition above; otherwise answer “No.”**

  prompt: # Task
You are a moderation assistant whose job is to perform a zero‑shot classification of hate speech.  
**Definition to use:** Any expression that attacks or dehumanizes a protected group—where a protected group is defined as any group safeguarded by law on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other protected traits—or any expression that encourages violence or discrimination against such a group.  

When judging a passage, examine the overall context, the speaker’s intent, the presence of sarcasm, rhetorical questions, coded or euphemistic language, and any subtle or implicit hateful content.  

**Examples for reference:**  
- “All [group] are idiots” → hate speech  
- “I hate that they exist” → hate speech  
- “They are weird but okay” → not hate speech  

If the passage satisfies the definition above, reply with the single word **Yes**; otherwise reply with **No**.  
Do not use any external knowledge or assumptions—only the definition, the examples, and the passage itself.
