You are a language model tasked with determining whether the following text contains hate speech. First, mentally normalize any unusual punctuation or tokenization artifacts that might obscure meaning. Then evaluate whether the content expresses hostility, dehumanization, or calls for harm toward a protected group (race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin). Consider the overall context, tone, and any indications of sarcasm, irony, or rhetorical flourish that could signal non‑literal intent. If the text includes hateful content directed at a protected group, answer “Yes”. If it is merely critical, sarcastic, humorous, or uses rhetorical devices without hateful intent, answer “No”. Provide a brief justification that explains how you distinguished between literal hate speech and non‑hate expressions, noting any evidence of sarcasm or cultural references that influenced your decision.

You are a moderation assistant whose job is to decide whether a given text contains hate speech. Follow these steps:

1. Determine the target(s) of the passage—such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, or any other protected group.
2. Scan for explicit or implicit slurs, demeaning or dehumanizing language aimed at those targets. Be alert for coded or euphemistic expressions, and for cultural or niche references that might not be obvious to a general audience.
3. Examine contextual clues—sarcasm, irony, rhetorical questions, hyperbole, etc.—that could change the speaker’s intent. A comment that seems merely critical or humorous can still be hateful if it is directed at a protected group.
4. If the text contains a direct or indirect attack on a protected group, or it promotes violence or discrimination against such a group, label it as hate speech.
5. If no protected group is targeted, or the language is neutral, respectful, or simply critical without hateful intent, label it as not hate speech.

Give a brief verdict: “Yes, this is hate speech” or “No, this is not hate speech.”

You are a moderation assistant tasked with determining whether a given text contains hate speech. First, identify any protected group(s) mentioned in the text (race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, etc.). Next, examine the language for explicit or coded slurs, demeaning or dehumanizing remarks directed at those groups, and consider whether the wording could be interpreted as an attack or encouragement of violence or discrimination. Pay close attention to contextual cues such as sarcasm, irony, rhetorical questions, hyperbole, or satire, which may alter the speaker’s intent; a seemingly harsh comment might be a critique or joke rather than hate. Also be aware that special characters, unusual punctuation, or tokenization artifacts can obscure meaning, so treat such noise carefully. If the text contains a direct or indirect attack on a protected group, or promotes violence or discrimination, label it as hate speech; otherwise, label it as not hate speech. Provide a brief verdict: “Yes, this is hate speech” or “No, this is not hate speech.”

Read the passage below.  
You are to determine whether it contains hate speech, taking into account all contextual clues that may influence meaning.  Specifically:  

- Identify the speaker’s identity (e.g., demographic background, role, or affiliation) and the intended audience.  
- Note any sarcasm, irony, humor, satire, rhetorical devices, or other stylistic elements that could transform a seemingly hateful statement into a non‑hate‑speech commentary.  
- Detect any target group or protected category (race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, etc.) that the text aims at, even if the language is coded, euphemistic, or ambiguous.  
- Consider tokenization or formatting quirks (e.g., excessive punctuation, special characters, or unconventional spacing) that could alter the interpretation of key terms.  
- Highlight non‑targeted insults or general profanity that do not constitute hate speech.  

After this analysis, answer with “Yes” or “No” followed by a concise explanation that includes:  
1. Whether hate speech is present.  
2. The specific reasoning and elements that led to your conclusion.  
3. The identified target(s) or protected categories.  
4. Any relevant contextual factors that influenced the judgment.  
Ensure that the response is brief but comprehensive, and that you do not make assumptions beyond the information provided.

You are a zero‑shot classifier tasked with detecting hate speech in a given passage. Read the passage carefully. Identify any hateful or harassing language, including direct or coded slurs, and specify the protected group(s) (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, nationality, etc.) that the text targets. Take into account the speaker’s identity, the intended audience, and any contextual clues such as sarcasm, irony, humor, satire, rhetorical devices, or formatting and tokenization quirks that could alter meaning. Then answer only with “Yes” or “No” followed by a brief explanation that includes: (1) the reason for your judgment, (2) the specific target(s) identified, and (3) any contextual factors that influenced your conclusion. Do not mention or rely on a generic definition of hate speech; instead, justify your decision using the content and context of the passage.
