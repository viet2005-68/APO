Hate speech is defined as any communication that targets individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability, with the intention of inciting harm, discrimination, or social exclusion.\n\nReasoning Process to Follow:\n1. **Identify Targeted Groups**: Check if the text is directed at a specific group based on protected characteristics.\n2. **Verify Intent**: Confirm if the language used is intended to provoke harm, discrimination, or social exclusion.\n3. **Assess Context and Tone**: Evaluate the broader context and tone of the text to see if it aligns with the definition of hate speech.\n4. **Examine Underlying Intent**: Carefully analyze the overall message and context to ensure accurate classification, especially for ambiguous statements.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. **Watch for Extreme Language and Slurs**: Look for harsh or derogatory language directed at specific groups.\n2. **Recognize Harmful Statements**: Identify statements expressing a desire to harm, discriminate against, or exclude a particular group.\n3. **Differentiate Between Offensive and Hate Speech**: Consider the intent and impact of the text to distinguish between offensive language and hate speech.\n4. **Consider Nuance and Context**: Take into account the broader context and subtleties of the text to avoid misclassification.\n5. **Address Sarcasm and Irony**: Pay close attention to sarcastic or ironic statements, as these can significantly alter the intent and impact of a statement.\n\nExample of Hate Speech:\n- "I would pull you over for your race, if I was a cop." (Yes)\n\nExample of Non-Hate Speech:\n- "They must be really struggling if they\'re throwing food all over the ground for the pigeons." (No)\n\nKey Points to Consider:\n- **Offensive vs. Hate Speech**: Understand the difference between general criticism and hate speech.\n- **Intent and Impact**: Focus on the intent and impact of the language rather than just the presence of negative words.\n- **Direct and Indirect Forms**: Differentiate between direct and indirect forms of hate speech, including subtle expressions and implications.\n- **Contextual Understanding**: Ensure the model comprehensively understands and differentiates various nuances and contexts to avoid misclassification.\n\nImproved Handling of Sarcasm and Irony:\n- "Indians are shit but burgers only have broken English and ebonics to learn and still fail. Second thread in a row where a burger can\'t figure out you\'re and your." (Yes) - The statement uses sarcasm to target Indians, implying racial prejudice.\n- "Deport him in military aircraft and dump him back where he is originally from. Him and his family." (Yes) - The statement expresses a desire to harm and discriminate against immigrants.\n- "I\'d beat the fuck out of his ass if he wasn\'t an actor." (Yes) - The statement conveys a clear intent to harm, even though it’s directed at a specific individual.\n- "Dalit? Is this a name of a religion or an atom of poo composition?" (Yes) - The statement uses derogatory language and implies prejudice against a specific group.\n\nImproved Handling of Nuanced and Indirect Hate Speech:\n- "Huh kids like this with crazy eyes and weird moves lurking around are scary. Please mama of this creeper cuff him and sent him to an asylum." (No) - The text criticizes behavior but does not target a specific group based on protected characteristics.\n- "Seen the way the Israelis treat the Palestinians? Slaughter on a weekly basis, very racist are the Israelis to the point of genocide." (Yes) - The statement criticizes actions and beliefs but does not directly target a specific group based on protected characteristics.\n- "We have to take our power back as the superior gender." (No) - The statement expresses a general opinion without targeting a specific group based on protected characteristics.\n- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that\'s disgraceful." (No) - The statement criticizes behavior and cultural attitudes but does not target a specific group based on protected characteristics.\n\nBy focusing on these guidelines and examples, the model will be better equipped to handle nuanced and indirect forms of hate speech, ensuring more accurate and reliable classifications.\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:\n', '# Task\nVariation:\n\nTask: This is a classification task to identify instances of hate speech in text.\nTask detailed description: Your goal is to determine whether the provided text contains hate speech.

(Yes) - The statement uses derogatory language and implies prejudice against a specific group.\n\nBy incorporating these improvements, the model will be better prepared to handle nuanced and context-dependent language, resulting in more accurate classifications.\n\nAdditional Guidelines:\n- For texts that express admiration for someone who has committed violent acts, consider the context and intent. If the admiration is not directed towards the act itself but rather the person, it may not be classified as hate speech.\n- For texts that criticize someone\'s skills or abilities without targeting a broader group, focus on the overall message and context to avoid misclassification.\n- Be cautious when interpreting coded language or euphemisms that may imply prejudice or discrimination against a specific group based on physical attributes.\n\nExample of additional handling:\n- "Magnificient. Contrary to what the media reports, I have hope for the people of Europe to expel these leeches." (Yes) - The statement expresses a desire to harm and discriminate against a specific group.\n- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that\'s disgraceful."
