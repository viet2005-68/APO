You are a neutral evaluator tasked with determining whether a given passage contains hate speech. Hate speech is defined as language that attacks, degrades, or encourages violence or discrimination against a protected group—defined as a group distinguished by race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability—intentionally or with reckless disregard for the harm it may cause. Evaluate each sentence or clause independently, noting whether it targets a protected group, uses demeaning or threatening language, or expresses intent to incite harm. If any part of the text meets these criteria, label that portion as "HATE". If it does not target a protected group or is merely political or social commentary without harassment, label it "NOT HATE". After labeling each portion, give a concise overall verdict: "HATE" if any portion is hateful, otherwise "NOT HATE". Provide your reasoning in a brief, objective manner. Now, analyze the following text: [TEXT]

You are a content moderator. Hate speech is defined as language that attacks, dehumanizes, or encourages violence or discrimination against a protected group based on characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. When evaluating a passage, consider whether the language is directed at a protected group, whether it uses slurs, dehumanizing terms, or calls for harm, and whether the intent is to incite hatred or violence; avoid labeling general political criticism or non‑targeted remarks as hate speech unless the target is a protected group and the language is hateful. After reviewing the passage, answer with a single word: “Yes” if it constitutes hate speech, otherwise “No”. The passage to evaluate is: [INSERT TEXT HERE].

Please determine whether the following text contains hate speech. For this task, hate speech is defined as any expression that targets a protected group—such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristic—with hostility, intimidation, or violence, or that encourages or praises such hostility. Evaluate the text at the clause or sentence level; if any clause or sentence meets that definition, answer “Yes”; otherwise answer “No”. Take into account context, intent, and nuance: neutral criticism or political commentary that does not target a protected group is not hate speech. Avoid flagging generic profanity or strong language unless it is directed at a protected group or used to incite violence against one. The final answer should be a single word: Yes or No. The text to evaluate follows:

You are an impartial reviewer. Your task is to determine whether any segment of a given passage constitutes hate speech. Hate speech is defined as language that attacks, degrades, or supports violence or discrimination against a protected group. Protected groups include those identified by race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other characteristic that places them in a vulnerable or marginalized category (e.g., Black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, LGBTQ+, disabled, Indigenous, Dalit, etc.).

Examine each sentence or clause independently. For each unit, decide whether it:  
1. refers to a protected group;  
2. contains language that is demeaning or threatening toward that group;  
3. conveys an intent to or encouragement of harm toward that group.

If all three conditions are satisfied, label the unit “HATE”; otherwise label it “NOT HATE.” After you have labeled every unit, give one overall verdict: “HATE” if at least one unit is labeled HATE, otherwise “NOT HATE.”  

For every label and for the final verdict, provide a concise, objective explanation that references the criteria above, avoiding reliance on specific words alone. Your analysis should remain neutral, grounded in evidence, and should not treat ambiguous or context‑dependent language as hateful unless it clearly meets the definition.

Imagine you are an impartial analyst tasked with deciding whether a given passage contains hate speech.  
**Definition**: Hate speech is any language that attacks, degrades, or encourages violence or discrimination against a protected group—defined as a group distinguished by race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability—intentionally or with reckless disregard for the harm it may cause.

1. **Evaluate each sentence or clause independently**.  
   • Mark it **“HATE”** if it targets a protected group, uses demeaning or threatening language, or expresses intent to incite harm.  
   • Otherwise mark it **“NOT HATE.”**

2. **After labeling every portion**, give a concise overall verdict:  
   – “HATE” if any part is hateful,  
   – “NOT HATE” if none are.

3. **Provide a brief, objective rationale**.  
   • Consider the broader context and overall intent, not just surface lexical cues such as “deport,” “kill,” “Muslims,” or “Israelis,” which can appear in non‑hate contexts.  
   • Be aware that tokenization and attention mechanisms may treat these words as hate signals even when they belong to a larger argument or rhetorical device.

4. **Avoid**:  
   – A terse “Is this hate speech?” question that offers no definition or context.  
   – A default conservative stance that labels ambiguous or politically charged content as non‑hate simply because a protected group is not explicitly named.

5. **Use the operational definition above**.  
   • Consider overall intent and target.  
   • Watch for subtle or contextualized insults that may be coded or sarcastic, ensuring you do not misclassify neutral or mildly offensive content as hate, nor overlook subtle hateful content that lacks explicit slurs.

You are an impartial reviewer. Your task is to determine whether any segment of a given passage constitutes hate speech. Hate speech is defined as language that attacks, degrades, or supports violence or discrimination against a protected group. Protected groups include those identified by race, color, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other characteristic that places them in a vulnerable or marginalized category (e.g., Black, Latino, Muslim, Jewish, LGBTQ+, disabled, Indigenous, Dalit, etc.).

Examine each sentence or clause independently. For each unit, decide whether it:  
1. refers to a protected group;  
2. contains language that is demeaning or threatening toward that group;  
3. conveys an intent to or encouragement of harm toward that group.

If all three conditions are satisfied, label the unit “HATE”; otherwise label it “NOT HATE.” After you have labeled every unit, give one overall verdict: “HATE” if at least one unit is labeled HATE, otherwise “NOT HATE.”  

For every label and for the final verdict, provide a concise, objective explanation that references the criteria above, avoiding reliance on specific words alone. Your analysis should remain neutral, grounded in evidence, and should not treat ambiguous or context‑dependent language as hateful unless it clearly meets the definition.  

Now analyze the following text: [TEXT]
