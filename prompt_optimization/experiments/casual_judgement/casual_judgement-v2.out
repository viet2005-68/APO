You are an AI assistant that performs a binary classification.
For each passage, you will read the paragraph and then answer the question exactly with either **"Yes"** or **"No"**.

**Question**: “Did [cause] cause [effect]?”

You should evaluate the logical connection described in the paragraph.
- If the paragraph states that the effect occurs **because** of the cause (or the cause is the direct reason for the effect), answer **“Yes.”**
- If the effect is due to another reason, or the cause is not the direct reason for the effect, answer **“No.”**

Do not provide any additional explanation or reasoning.

**Example 1**
*Text*: “Karen was an assistant editor…Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease…she died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?”
*Answer*: **No**

**Example 2**
*Text*: “Louie is playing a game of basketball…Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3‑point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?”
*Answer*: **No**

**Example 3**
*Text*: “David has a new dryer…Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?”
*Answer*: **Yes**

**Example 4**
*Text*: “Billy and Suzy work for a company…If two people log in to the central computer at exactly 9:27 am, some work emails will be immediately deleted…Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails are deleted. Did Billy cause the emails to be deleted?”
*Answer*: **No**

Text: David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Text: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Text: In Nazi Germany, there was a law called the 'racial identification law.' The purpose of the law was to help identify people of certain races so that they could be rounded up and sent to concentration camps. Shortly after this law was passed, the CEO of a small corporation decided to make certain organizational changes. The Vice-President of the corporation said: "By making those changes, you'll definitely be increasing our profits. But you'll also be fulfilling the requirements of the racial identification law." The CEO said: "Look, I know that I'll be fulfilling the requirements of the law, but I don't care one bit about that. All I care about is making as much profit as I can. Let's make those organizational changes!" As soon as the CEO gave this order, the corporation began making the organizational changes. Did the CEO intentionally fulfill the requirements of the law?

Text: Louie and Claire are playing a game of basketball, and they made a bet with their friends who are watching on the sidelines. If either Louie makes a 3-point shot or Claire makes a 3-point shot during the game, then they'll win $100 and split it down the middle. Just when the game started, Claire immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. She looked to the basket, focused her shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie, Claire, and their friends continued playing, but as hard as they tried, Louie and Claire couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because they would win $100 if either Louie made a 3-point shot or Claire made a 3- point shot, Louie and Claire won $100 and split it down the middle. Think about what could have been different in the story that you just read. Which event do you imagine happening differently: Claire making the 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie making the 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Did Louie and Claire win the $100 bet because Louie made the 3-point shot?

Text: A person, Joe, is playing a casino game where he reaches his hand into two boxes and blindly draws a ball from each box. He wins a dollar if and only if he gets a green ball from the left box and a blue ball from the right box. It is unlikely that he gets a green ball from the first box. It is very likely that he gets a blue ball in the second box. Joe closes his eyes, reaches in, and chooses a green ball from the first box and a blue ball from the second box. So Joe wins a dollar. Did Joe's first choice cause him to win a dollar?
