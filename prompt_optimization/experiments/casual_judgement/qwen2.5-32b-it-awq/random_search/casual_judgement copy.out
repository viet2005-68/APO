# Here are some examples:
Text: Louie and Claire are playing a game of basketball, and they made a bet with their friends who are watching on the sidelines. If either Louie makes a 3-point shot or Claire makes a 3-point shot during the game, then they'll win $100 and split it down the middle. Just when the game started, Claire immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. She looked to the basket, focused her shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie, Claire, and their friends continued playing, but as hard as they tried, Louie and Claire couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because they would win $100 if either Louie made a 3-point shot or Claire made a 3- point shot, Louie and Claire won $100 and split it down the middle. Think about what could have been different in the story that you just read. Which event do you imagine happening differently: Claire making the 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie making the 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Did Louie and Claire win the $100 bet because Louie made the 3-point shot?

Text: Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe logs in at 9:30 am, when Alice is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

Text: Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?

Text: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment." The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?

However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life."
