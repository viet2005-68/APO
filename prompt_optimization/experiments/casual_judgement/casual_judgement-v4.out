Text: David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is set on HIGH. He does not change the setting at all, and he leaves the temperature set to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?

Text: In a particular building there are two businesses, a travel agency and a graphic design studio. The building's climate control system is a new design that saves energy by keeping track of the number of people in the building, and only turning on when enough people have entered the building. The climate control system will only turn on when the people who work at the travel agency and the people who work in the design studio arrive for work. Neither office has enough employees to turn on the climate control system on their own. The travel agency employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am, and the design studio employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am. Today, the travel agency employees arrived at 8:45 am. The design studio employees also arrived at 8:45 am, as usual. So, today, the climate control system turned on at 8:45 am. Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
