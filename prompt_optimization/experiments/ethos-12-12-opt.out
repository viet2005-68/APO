Does this passage include hate speech, biased opinions, or incitements to harm any particular race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected group? Assess whether the material explicitly advocates for discrimination, hatred, or intolerance against people or communities due to their inherent traits. Also, determine if the writing disparages cultural customs, traditions, or celebrations linked to certain groups in a manner that fosters hostility or bias. It's crucial to differentiate between criticism of specific actions, policies, or conduct, which might not target protected categories, and wording that singles out individuals because of their core identities. Moreover, consider the general tone and underlying purpose of the text to maintain a balanced evaluation.

Does this piece of writing include any prejudiced or discriminatory language—whether overtly stated or subtly hinted—at any particular race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected category? Examine if the material utilizes offensive terms, advances harmful stereotypes, or resorts to dehumanizing rhetoric. Assess whether the wording intends to foster or perpetuate a hostile atmosphere toward these groups. Even when the text doesn't explicitly identify a protected group, determine if it suggests hostility, disdain, or provokes discrimination through implications. Also, consider the general tone and setting within which the statement is made. While discussions about historical events, social problems, or cultural customs might involve delicate subjects, they are not necessarily prejudiced unless they employ language that indicates hostility or prejudice toward a protected category. Make sure your evaluation includes hidden biases and more discreet types of discrimination. Bear in mind that statements that are impartial or refrain from engaging in prejudiced talk should be deemed free of prejudiced language.
