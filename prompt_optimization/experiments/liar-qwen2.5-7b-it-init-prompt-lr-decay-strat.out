Assess the plausibility of the statement considering the given context, including the speaker’s position and the circumstances.\n3. Evaluate the speaker’s background and any potential biases that might affect their statements.\n4. Use logical reasoning to scrutinize the statement’s coherence and truthfulness, while factoring in the speaker’s influence and policy stances.\nIllustrative examples:\n- A city council member claiming high employment rates should match up with official statistical data and regional economic trends.\n- A Democratic politician promoting stricter environmental regulations would typically base their arguments on scientific evidence rather than suggesting dishonesty.\n- Personal attacks on an opponent’s policies are frequent in political debates but do not inherently indicate deception.\n- A legislator’s views on social issues should be interpreted within the context of their public persona and political role, acknowledging possible inconsistencies.\nConclusion: While the speaker’s role, affiliations, and environment are important, they should not be the primary basis for judging the statement’s veracity. Focus on the factual accuracy and logical integrity of the statement, while properly evaluating the context and the speaker’s known positions.\n\nIf the statement is clearly false or contradicts well-established facts, classify it as a lie, irrespective of the speaker’s background or context.\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:\n')
