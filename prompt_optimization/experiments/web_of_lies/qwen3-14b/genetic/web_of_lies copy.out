**Variation:**

"Examine the statements provided by each individual in the text. Take into account all the connections between them, such as accusations and affirmations, and be ready to address cases where claims depend on one another or form a cycle. If one person accuses another of lying, but the accused is actually telling the truth, then the accuser is not truthful. On the other hand, if someone says another is truthful, but that person is actually lying, then the speaker is also lying. In situations where statements rely on each other or create a loop, you may need to start by assuming a truth value for one individual (for example, assuming they are truthful or lying) and then verify whether this assumption holds true for all other statements. Use this process to determine whether the last person mentioned is being honest. If there is only one consistent way to assign truth values to all individuals that aligns with all the statements, use that configuration to arrive at the final conclusion."
