Do not automatically discount tweets and other informal communications; however, prioritize official statements from recognized experts as they tend to be more reliable. Handle campaign materials, advertisements, and promotional content with caution, regarding them as unverified until supported by unbiased sources. To validate the Statement's accuracy, especially for economic or sector-specific assertions, cross-reference it with credible news outlets, government records, and other reliable data sources.\n\nBe particularly cautious when the Statement pertains to subjects outside the individual's professional expertise or geographic region. The individual must have a genuine connection to the topic or a strong rationale for making the Statement. Without a clear rationale, the Statement should be deemed less trustworthy unless corroborated by reliable evidence.\n\nDifferentiate between statements made directly by the individual and those they attribute to others. Verify any quoted statements from other people using credible sources. Recognize that some Statements may represent opinions rather than factual claims. When dealing with opinion-based Statements, assess whether they align with known facts or expert perspectives, and seek verification whenever possible.\n\nWhen evaluating economic or industry-related claims, ensure they align with pertinent economic indicators and industry trends. For instance, compare employment growth rates across various sectors using recent labor market statistics and industry analyses. This process aids in verifying the accuracy of claims about economic changes or shifts.\n\nThis approach seeks to provide a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation, concentrating on verifiable facts irrespective of the communication channel or superficial connections.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:", "# Task\nInstruction: Evaluate if the given Statement is false (Yes) or true (No) by carefully reviewing the Context. Take into account the individual's Professional History, Living Location, Political Affiliations (Party), and the Situation where the Statement was made (e.g., during an interview, tweeted, or included in a newsletter). Give preference to statements backed by experts, as these tend to be more credible. For assertions originating from less formal sources like tweets, apply extra caution, particularly when they involve intricate global matters or significantly diverge from the individual’s area of expertise or local context. Cross-check the Statement with independent evidence, dependable news outlets, government records, and other trustworthy information sources to confirm its validity. Should the original source be a less formal channel or possibly biased content like campaign materials, seek confirmation from several credible sources before determining the Statement’s accuracy. Make sure your conclusions are based on verifiable evidence, avoiding quick judgments based merely on how the information was conveyed.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:", "# Task\nInstruction: Evaluate if the given Statement is false (Yes) or true (No) by carefully analyzing the Context. Take into account the individual's Professional Experience, Place of Residence, Political Affiliations (Party), and the Circumstance under which the Statement was made (e.g., during an interview, shared on Twitter, or included in a newsletter). Focus on the reliability and credibility of the Context by assessing the person's level of expertise and the typical reliability of the source. Expert assertions tend to be more credible. For statements regarding complex global affairs, cross-check with multiple dependable international relations sources. Do not immediately disregard a statement just because it came from an informal medium like a tweet. Heighten your scrutiny if the Statement is from a context significantly different from the individual’s professional field or geographic background, unless there is a reasonable explanation for their involvement. Be cautious of Statements without supporting evidence, especially if they originate from materials that might have inherent biases, such as campaign literature, advertisements, or promotional content. Cross-reference the Statement with credible news outlets, official government documents, and other reliable information sources. For localized claims, give preference to local economic statistics and employment records. When national personalities address local issues, look for specialized local analyses to confirm accuracy, particularly in highly politicized situations. This method guarantees a thorough, impartial assessment based on verifiable evidence.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:")
