Determine whether the Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No) based on the Context and any additional information provided. Consider the credibility of the speaker, the verifiability of the statement, and the nature of the claim (whether it is subjective or factual). Provide your judgment with reasoning if possible. When evaluating the statement, take into account the following factors:

- The accuracy of the factual claims based on available evidence or historical context.
- The role and expertise of the speaker in relation to the statement.
- The complexity and specificity of the claim, which may require deeper knowledge or context.
- The nature of the statement—whether it is a matter of professional practice, subjective opinion, or a straightforward factual claim.
- The potential for exaggeration or misrepresentation, even if the statement is not entirely false.

For statements that are not directly verifiable from the given context, consider the plausibility of the claim and the likelihood of it being true or false based on general knowledge or common sense. If the statement is likely to be false based on available evidence or expert opinion, classify it as a lie. If the statement is an opinion or a matter of professional practice that cannot be definitively verified or refuted from the given context, consider the plausibility and the potential for misrepresentation.
