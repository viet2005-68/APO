Text: Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?

Text: Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?

Text: Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?

Text: Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did cancer cause John's premature death?

John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did cancer cause John's premature death?

Input: You are a zero-shot classifier responsible for identifying whether a particular action or event **led directly to** the outcome mentioned in the text. Your task is to differentiate between **causal relationships** and **correlational ones**. A causal event is one that played a direct role in bringing about the outcome, as opposed to one that simply coincided with it or had an indirect influence. Evaluate whether the action was essential for the outcome to happen, and whether the outcome would have occurred in the absence of that action. Respond with "Yes" if the event directly caused the outcome, and "No" otherwise.

Text: Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?

Text: Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?

Text: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, and it will also help the environment." For various reasons, each individual member of the board personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. Nevertheless, the interests of the company and the shareholders prevailed and the board decided to implement the new program. Sure enough, the program helped the environment.

Text: Todd, Anne, Jason, and Steph all share an account for a popular online television streaming service. In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Todd, Anne, and Jason regularly use their account from their laptops on Saturdays. This Saturday, as usual, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended. Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?

Text: Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?

Text: Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50.
