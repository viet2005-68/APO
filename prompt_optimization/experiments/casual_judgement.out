Text: Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?

Text: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, and it will also help the environment."

Nevertheless, the interests of the company and the shareholders prevailed and the board decided to implement the new program. Sure enough, the program helped the environment. Did the board intentionally help the environment?

Text: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is not on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it's not. So, he changes the position of the device, and he puts it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne changed the position of the device?

Text: Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?

Text: Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
