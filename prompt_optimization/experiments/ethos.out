Is this passage considered hate speech, which involves showing bias or hostility toward people or groups due to their race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability? For it to be categorized as hate speech, the content needs to contain clearly offensive words, negative generalizations, or direct assaults focused on these protected traits. Mere disagreement or critique about actions or policies does not qualify. Crucial for recognizing hate speech is the use of language that discriminates by undermining, dehumanizing, or threatening a protected group.

Identify hate speech as content specifically targeting race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability with prejudiced or hostile language. To distinguish hate speech from criticism, consider whether the content attacks or degrades individuals or groups based solely on their protected characteristics rather than their actions or beliefs. Examples of non-hate speech include expressing frustration or dissatisfaction without targeting protected characteristics, discussing actions unrelated to group membership, or critiquing religious practices rather than individuals.

This text will undergo assessment to identify whether it qualifies as hate speech. Hate speech is characterized by expressing bias or animosity towards individuals or groups due to their race, ethnicity, religion, country of origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability. For the text to be deemed hate speech, it should explicitly focus on one or more of these specified traits in a prejudiced way, instead of commenting on general behaviors or subjects. If the text conveys bias or animosity towards individuals or groups purely based on their affiliation with a protected class, it will be categorized as hate speech. Conversely, if the text critiques beliefs, activities, or actions without focusing on a protected attribute, it will not be considered hate speech.

  prompt: # Task
Recognize hate speech as expressions that specifically aim at individuals or groups based on traits such as race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, using biased or aggressive language. Distinguish this from legitimate criticism by examining if the content targets people for who they are rather than what they do or believe. Criticism should focus on specific behaviors, policies, or actions rather than attacking someone's core identity. Non-hate speech examples include voicing discontent without singling out protected traits, commenting on actions that don't stem from group affiliations, or criticizing practices of a religion instead of its followers. Furthermore, expression of intense negative feelings should not be labeled as hate speech if it criticizes actions or policies rather than the personal characteristics of individuals.

  prompt: # Task
Is this passage considered hate speech, which involves showing bias or hostility toward people or groups due to their race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability? For it to be categorized as hate speech, the content needs to contain clearly offensive words, negative generalizations, or direct assaults focused on these protected traits. Mere disagreement or critique about actions or policies does not qualify. Crucial for recognizing hate speech is the use of language that discriminates by undermining, dehumanizing, or threatening a protected group.

This content will be evaluated to determine if it constitutes hate speech. Hate speech is defined as communication that displays prejudice or hostility toward people or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability. To be classified as hate speech, the content must specifically target one or more of these characteristics with discriminatory intent, rather than addressing general conduct or topics. Although the use of racial slurs or insulting terms aimed at protected categories often points to hate speech, the overall context and purpose of the language used should also be taken into account. If the content exhibits prejudice or hostility toward individuals or groups solely because of their association with a protected class, it will be identified as hate speech. However, if the content criticizes beliefs, actions, or behaviors without concentrating on a protected characteristic, it will not be labeled as hate speech.

  prompt: # Task
Detect instances of hate speech, defined as communications that single out individuals or groups due to inherent attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability, through the use of prejudiced or harsh language. Differentiate between hate speech and valid critique by assessing if the content targets an individual’s fundamental identity rather than their conduct, policies, or activities. Expressions classified as hate speech encompass, but are not limited to, explicit racial epithets, insulting terms directed at marginalized groups, or statements suggesting that someone should be institutionalized based on their physical traits. Remarks concerning specific actions, policies, or behaviors towards individuals do not fall under hate speech unless they employ discriminatory language relating to protected statuses. For instance, voicing dissatisfaction with a policy or action without emphasizing protected traits, discussing actions independent of group associations, or critiquing religious practices without targeting the practitioners, do not qualify as hate speech. Conversely, utilizing extremely negative terminology that focuses on the personal characteristics of individuals is invariably categorized as hate speech. Moreover, unequivocal examples of hate speech involve overtly insulting or derogatory remarks directed at particular groups, irrespective of the surrounding context.
