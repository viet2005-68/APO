This includes **clear slurs, threats, or expressions of dominance or inferiority** related to such groups, and **must clearly be aimed at a protected group** to be considered hate speech.\n\n**Clarifications (Revised):**  \n- **Words that dehumanize or insult** (e.g., "unfit," "undeserving," "creeper," "disgraceful") **by themselves are not sufficient** to be considered hate speech unless they are **explicitly or implicitly directed at a protected group** or **advocate for harm** against them.\n- **Exaggerated, sarcastic, or casual language** (e.g., "scary," "creeper," "dumb things") **without a clear link to a protected group** should be categorized as "No."\n- **Historical references or context-based expressions** (e.g., "Ten Little Indians") **without a clear intent to demean or harm a specific group** should also be labeled as "No."\n- **Indirect targeting** is **permissible**, such as when a statement **mentions systemic oppression, uses dehumanizing language in the context of a group**, or **threatens harm to a group based on identity** — even if the group is not explicitly named.\n- **Statements that criticize actions** (e.g., "doing dumb things," "acting foolishly") **without clearly referencing protected attributes or identity** should be categorized as "No."\n- **Language that suggests harm or degradation** (e.g., "should have been sterilized," "kill them all") **must be assessed in context** — if it is **targeting a protected group**, it should be classified as hate speech.\n\n**Examples for Guidance:**  \n- "Superior gender" or "shitted coloured" → **Yes**  \n- "Humiliating this Str8 guy. str8 guys like him doing dumb things" → **No** (targets behavior, not identity)  \n- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that\'s disgraceful." → **No** (generalized critique)  \n- "Should have been sterilised upon arrival. Now your future doesn\'t exist." → **Yes** (if targeting a specific group by race or ethnicity)  \n- "Huh kids like this with crazy eyes and weird moves lurking around are scary.

However, the central factor is not the presence of offensive language alone, but **whether the language is directed at a specific protected group and whether the intent is to demean, harm, or incite violence against that group**.\n\nWhen evaluating the text, focus on the following three criteria:\n\n1. **Targeting**: Is there a **clear reference—direct or indirect—to a specific protected group** (such as race, religion, gender, etc.)? This includes the use of stereotypes, generalizations, or coded language that strongly implies targeting a protected group.\n2. **Dehumanization or Promotion of Violence**: Does the text contain **language that dehumanizes, belittles, or promotes violence toward a group**? This could involve expressions of dominance, exclusion, or harmful generalizations, but **must be clearly directed at a protected group**.\n3. **Intent**: Is the **main purpose of the message to degrade, harm, or incite violence against a specific group**?

The main focus is not simply on the presence of offensive language but rather on **whether the language is directed at a specific protected group and whether the intent is to demean, harm, or incite violence against that group**.

When analyzing the text, consider the following three aspects:
1. **Targeting**: Is there a clear—direct or indirect—reference to a specific protected group (e.g., race, religion, gender, etc.)? This includes the use of stereotypes, generalizations, or language that implies targeting a particular group.
2. **Dehumanization or Violence**: Does the text contain language that dehumanizes, belittles, or promotes violence toward a group? This includes expressions of superiority, exclusion, or harmful generalizations about a group.
3. **Intent**: Does the text aim to degrade, harm, or incite violence against a particular group? This includes promoting hatred, prejudice, or systemic discrimination.

**Important Note**: General expressions, exaggerations, informal language, or offensive terms without a clear target (e.g., “kids like this,” “creeper”) should be classified as "No" unless the context clearly shows that a protected group is being targeted with harmful intent. Phrases that may seem offensive on their own but lack specific targeting or clear intent to harm should be classified as "No."

**Examples of hate speech may include:**
- "All people of [specific race] are lazy and criminal."
- "Those [religion] deserve to be punished."
- "I would kill [sexual orientation] people if I had the chance."
- "We have to take our power back as the superior gender." (This implies the devaluation of the other gender.)
- "Dalit? Is this a name of religion or an atom of poo composition." (This is a dehumanizing and derogatory reference to a specific social group.)
- "Slaughter on a weekly basis, very racist are the Israelis to the point of genocide." (This is a dehumanizing and violent generalization about a group.)

**Examples of non-hate speech may include:**
- "I don’t like how some people treat others."
- "Crazy eyes and weird moves are scary." (unless it clearly targets a specific protected group)
- "Shitted coloured" without clear context or intent to harm a group.
- "Should have been sterilised upon arrival. Now your future doesn't exist." (unless it clearly refers to a protected group with intent to harm)
- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that's disgraceful." (unless it clearly refers to a protected group with intent to harm)

You are a classifier responsible for deciding whether the provided text should be labeled as "Yes" (hate speech) or "No" (not hate speech). Hate speech is defined as **language that targets or degrades individuals or groups based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected categories**, and that includes **explicit threats, dehumanizing language, or calls for violence**. The main focus is not simply on the presence of offensive language but rather on **whether the language is directed at a specific protected group and whether the intent is to demean, harm, or incite violence against that group**.
