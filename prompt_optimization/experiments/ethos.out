  prompt: # Task
You are asked: “Is the following text hate speech?”  
First, identify any protected group or demographic mentioned.  
Then, evaluate whether the language explicitly degrades, demonizes, or calls for harm against that group.  
If the text contains profanity, slurs, or demeaning descriptors, proceed to the next check:  
 • If the surrounding context explains the use of such language as historical critique, academic discussion, or rhetorical irony, note that the intent is not to incite harm.  
 • If the context lacks clear justification—e.g., the language is presented as a general statement or a call for violence—then classify it as hate speech.  
If the text does not contain obvious slurs but includes negative stereotypes or dismissive remarks toward a protected group, examine intent:  
 • If the speaker is critiquing policies or actions of the group’s institutions, and the tone remains analytical rather than dehumanizing, treat as non‑hate speech.  
 • If the remarks imply inherent inferiority or justify prejudice, treat as hate speech.  
When sarcasm or rhetorical flourish appears, assess whether the message ultimately supports or rejects the group:  
 • If sarcasm is used to expose hateful ideas, it is not hate speech.  
 • If sarcasm masks a hateful agenda, it is hate speech.  
Finally, consider the broader discourse: if the text is part of a larger narrative that encourages discrimination or violence, classify as hate speech; if it is a balanced critique without malicious intent, classify as not hate speech.  
Always err on the side of caution: when intent is ambiguous, default to “not hate speech” unless clear evidence of hateful intent is present.  
Answer with a single statement: “Yes, it is hate speech.” or “No, it is not hate speech.”

  prompt: # Task
You will receive a paragraph and must decide whether it constitutes hate speech. Use the following decision tree:

1. **Identify protected groups**  
   - Does the text reference any protected category—race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or nationality?  
   - If there is no such reference, label the passage “No” (not hate speech) and stop.

2. **Assess the language used**  
   - If a protected group is mentioned, look for explicit slurs, profanity, or dehumanizing wording aimed at that group.  
   - If the wording is neutral or merely descriptive, answer “No” and stop.  
   - If slurs or dehumanizing terms are present, proceed to step 3.

3. **Consider context and intent**  
   - Is the passage part of a historical analysis, academic critique, or clearly sarcastic commentary that signals the speaker does *not* intend to promote violence or discrimination? If so, label “No.”  
   - Does the text contain a call to action that encourages hatred, violence, or exclusion against the protected group? If yes, label “Yes.”  
   - If intent is unclear (e.g., rhetorical flourish or ambiguous satire), default to “No” but note the uncertainty in a brief justification.

4. **Handle profanity unrelated to protected groups**  
   - Strong language that does *not* target a protected group is not hate speech unless it is paired with a protected‑group target and the purpose is to demean or incite harm.

5. **Resolve conflicting signals**  
   - When a protected‑group slur appears alongside a historical grievance or critique, evaluate which tone dominates. A strong dehumanizing tone overrides mitigating context.  
   - If the overall message leans toward hostility, classify as “Yes.” If it remains primarily critical or sarcastic without advocating harm, classify as “No.”

Always provide a concise, objective justification for your decision, quoting the relevant portion of the text that guided your judgment. If intent is uncertain, state that explicitly and lean toward “No.”

**Revised Instruction**

**Input:**  
Analyze the supplied passage and decide whether it constitutes hate speech. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify Target** – First, determine if the text explicitly targets a protected group (e.g., race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected category).  
   - If *no* protected group is targeted, respond with **“No.”**

2. **Assess Intent & Context** – If a protected group is targeted, examine the tone and surrounding context:  
   - If the language is a critique or disagreement that is non‑violent, non‑derogatory, or includes historical references, sarcasm, or rhetorical flourish indicating no advocacy of harm, answer **“No.”**  
   - If the passage contains slurs, dehumanizing language, calls for violence, or an unmistakable intent to intimidate or discriminate, answer **“Yes.”**

3. **Contextual Stereotypes** – When negative stereotypes are mentioned, check for contextual qualifiers such as “in the context of,” “historically,” “to critique,” etc.  
   - Weigh these qualifiers against any direct incitement; if they sufficiently explain the stereotype as part of a broader argument or historical discussion, the text may not be hate speech.

4. **Ambiguity** – If the passage mixes rhetorical layers or is unclear, provide a concise justification for your decision.

**Output:**  
Return either **“Yes”** or **“No.”** If “No,” include a brief rationale when the case is ambiguous or contains nuanced context. Avoid labeling negative language as hate speech unless it clearly advocates or supports violence or discrimination against a protected group. Be careful not to over‑generalize; ensure that criticisms lacking harmful intent are not misclassified.

1. **Identify Target**  
   First, determine if the passage explicitly points at a protected group—such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected category.  
   - If no protected group is targeted, answer **“No.”**

2. **Evaluate Tone and Context**  
   If a protected group is mentioned, examine the intent and surrounding context:  
   - **Non‑violent, non‑derogatory critique** (e.g., respectful disagreement, academic discussion, or rhetorical flourish that clearly shows no intent to harm) → **“No.”**  
   - **Presence of historical framing, sarcasm, or qualifiers** (phrases like “in the context of,” “historically,” or “to critique”) that signal the speaker is not advocating violence or discrimination should also lead to **“No.”**

3. **Check for Harmful Language**  
   If the passage contains:  
   - Slurs or dehumanizing remarks,  
   - Calls for violence, or  
   - Explicit intent to intimidate or discriminate,  
   then answer **“Yes.”**

4. **Handle Ambiguity**  
   For passages that are unclear or mix rhetorical layers, provide a concise explanation of your decision.  
   - Avoid labeling negative language as hate speech unless it clearly promotes or supports violence or discrimination against a protected group.  
   - Ensure that legitimate criticism or opinion that does not aim to harm is not misidentified as hate speech.

**Remember:** The goal is to distinguish between harmful, intent‑driven content and legitimate, non‑harmful critique or discussion.

**Revised Guidance**

Your task is to decide whether a given passage constitutes hate speech. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify Target**  
   First, determine if the passage explicitly points at a protected group—such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected category.  
   - If no protected group is targeted, answer **“No.”**

2. **Evaluate Tone and Context**  
   If a protected group is mentioned, examine the intent and surrounding context:  
   - **Non‑violent, non‑derogatory critique** (e.g., respectful disagreement, academic discussion, or rhetorical flourish that clearly shows no intent to harm) → **“No.”**  
   - **Presence of historical framing, sarcasm, or qualifiers** (phrases like “in the context of,” “historically,” or “to critique”) that signal the speaker is not advocating violence or discrimination should also lead to **“No.”**

3. **Check for Harmful Language**  
   If the passage contains:  
   - Slurs or dehumanizing remarks,  
   - Calls for violence, or  
   - Explicit intent to intimidate or discriminate,  
   then answer **“Yes.”**

4. **Handle Ambiguity**  
   For passages that are unclear or mix rhetorical layers, provide a concise explanation of your decision.  
   - Avoid labeling negative language as hate speech unless it clearly promotes or supports violence or discrimination against a protected group.  
   - Ensure that legitimate criticism or opinion that does not aim to harm is not misidentified as hate speech.

**Remember:** The goal is to distinguish between harmful, intent‑driven content and legitimate, non‑harmful critique or discussion.
