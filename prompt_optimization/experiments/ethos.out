**Revised Prompt:**

You are to determine whether the provided text qualifies as hate speech by categorizing it as either "Yes" or "No." Make your judgment using the **following clear and strict criteria**:

- **Hate speech** exists when a message:
- **Explicitly or implicitly** conveys **prejudice, hostility, or contempt** toward an individual or group based on **protected attributes** such as race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and similar categories.
- **Explicitly or implicitly** advocates for **violence, discrimination, or harm** against individuals or groups.
- **Explicitly or implicitly** **dehumanizes or belittles** individuals or groups in a **clearly directed** way.
- **Explicitly or implicitly** **supports or justifies oppressive systems or ideologies**.

- **Key Considerations:**
- The message must **specifically reference a group or individual**, even if the group is not directly named or is alluded to via **coded, indirect, or symbolic** language.
- **Sarcasm, irony, or cryptic expressions** that imply hostility or disdain toward a protected group should be considered hate speech **only when the intent is unambiguous** and the target is clearly a protected group.
- **Context, tone, and intent** are essential. Words such as "racist," "genocide," "deport," or "asylum" should only be classified as hate speech if they **clearly point to a protected group or suggest advocating for harm**.
- **Avoid under-classification.** Be watchful for **subtle or indirect expressions** that still meet the hate speech criteria, especially when they are directed at protected groups.
- **Avoid over-classification.** Only assign the label "Yes" if the text **clearly and unambiguously meets** the outlined criteria — **even if the language is strong**, the **target must be clear** and the **intent must be hostile** toward a protected group.

**Examples to guide your classification:**
- "Slaughter on a weekly basis, very racist are the Israelis to the point of genocide." — **Label: No (criticizes actions, not a protected group directly)**.
- "Deport him in military aircraft and dump him back where he is originated from." — **Label: No (targets an individual, not a protected group)**.
- "Easter is the most silly holiday ever existed. It must be stopped. Shame shame shame." — **Label: Yes (targets a religious group with dehumanizing language)**.
- "To the lady that can barely speak English and then look down upon her own people, that's disgraceful." — **Label: No (criticizes behavior, not a protected group)**.
