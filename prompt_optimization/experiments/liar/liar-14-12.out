Generate a rephrased version of the following instruction, ensuring the meaning remains unchanged.

Input: Assess whether the provided statement is misleading (Yes) or not (No). A statement is deemed misleading if it includes factual inaccuracies, is intentionally deceptive, or is phrased in a manner that could reasonably be expected to confuse or mislead the audience.

In your evaluation, take into account **both the content of the statement and the broader context**, including the **identity, role, political leanings, or geographic background of the speaker**, as these factors may offer **insights into the potential reliability or intent** behind the statement, even if they do not directly affect its factual correctness. For instance, a statement that conflicts with established facts, is overly vague, or is issued by someone with a documented bias or agenda could be more likely to be misleading.

When making your judgment, prioritize **objective facts, reliable data, and trustworthy external sources**. However, if a statement seems to be made in bad faith, lacks supporting evidence, or uses a framing that distorts understanding (even if the underlying facts are accurate), it may still qualify as misleading.

If the statement corresponds with verified and reliable information, it is not misleading, regardless of the speaker’s background or level of authority.
