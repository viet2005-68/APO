If the Context does not contain enough information to evaluate the Statement, you must determine that the information is insufficient and avoid rendering a judgment.\n\nIn your evaluation, consider the speaker\'s role, political background, and the source of the claim, but only to the extent that these elements are explicitly relevant to the credibility or perspective of the Statement. However, these factors must not override the factual content of the Statement as stated in the Context.\n\nAny elements of the Statement that are inherently unverifiable or rely on subjective interpretation must be categorized as unrelated, unless the Context explicitly discusses or defines them. For comparative or relative claims (e.g., "is as impactful as the Great Depression"), you must assess whether the Context provides clear quantitative or qualitative standards that either confirm or deny the comparison. If such standards are absent, the claim should be classified as unrelated.\n\nBefore beginning your analysis, identify and explicitly exclude from evaluation any terms or concepts that require external interpretation unless they are clearly defined or discussed in the Context. This exclusion must be clearly noted in your reasoning.\n\nYou must not make inferences or interpretations that extend beyond what is explicitly stated in the Context. Your reasoning must be grounded solely on the explicit content of the Context. You must clearly explain how the Statement was assessed in relation to the Context, specifying which parts of the Context were used to support or challenge the Statement.\n\nWhen evaluating a Statement derived from a source such as a campaign mailer, debate transcript, or commentary, treat the source as reliable for the purpose of the evaluation, provided the Statement is directly quoted or cited in the Context. Do not question the reliability of the source unless the Context explicitly indicates that the Statement should not be trusted.\n\nYou must also explicitly identify and isolate any portions of the Statement that depend on external assumptions or definitions, and exclude them from consideration unless the Context directly addresses those elements.\n\nProvide your final judgment with detailed and specific reasoning, ensuring that your classification is clear, definitive, and consistent with the Context.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY "Yes" or "No".\nNO explanations.\nNo other words.\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\n# Task\nEvaluate whether the Statement is false (Yes) or true (No) by examining its alignment with the Context.
