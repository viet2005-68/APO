Account for potential exaggeration or misrepresentation in political discourse, and evaluate the verifiability and severity of the claim, even if it appears factually correct. During evaluation, also consider the speaker's party affiliation and any known biases. If the statement is partially true but requires additional context, explain why the overall claim is deemed accurate or a fabrication. Differentiate between factual statements and claims that might be true but are not lies; a lie is a statement known to be false by the speaker. Pay attention to the speaker's credibility and the context in which the statement was made, as these factors can greatly impact the statement's accuracy.

  prompt: # Task
Evaluate whether the Statement is a fabrication (Yes) or accurate (No) by examining the Context, the credibility of the Speaker, and the plausibility of the Claim. Assess the speaker's background and expertise, the broader policy context, and any potential distortions or overstatements in political discussions. Acknowledge the complexity and subjectivity involved in evaluating political statements and arguments. Consider the typical content and nature of the event or situation mentioned in the context, the source and credibility of the speaker, and whether the statement aligns with general knowledge or previous statements made by the speaker. Be aware of the possibility of exaggeration, misrepresentation, or deliberate misinformation in political discourse, and evaluate the verifiability and severity of the claim, even if it appears factually correct. Determine if the speaker is likely to possess the necessary knowledge to support their claims and whether the statement is likely to be a lie based on the speaker's expertise and the context. Provide your assessment along with an explanation of how these factors influenced your decision.
