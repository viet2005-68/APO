Prompt: ('# Task\nYou will receive a statement together with a job title, state, party affiliation, and a contextual background.  \nYour job is to determine whether the statement is a **lie** (Yes) or **not a lie** (No).  \nA statement qualifies as a lie if it contains factual inaccuracies or is misleading.\n\nFollow this procedure:\n\n1. **Extract the main assertion** presented in the statement.  \n2. **Gather relevant facts** from the supplied context that either confirm or refute that assertion.  \n3. **Assess the assertion** against those facts and against established knowledge up to 2023.  \n   - If the assertion is contradicted by the context or by known facts, answer **Yes**.  \n   - If the assertion is upheld by the context or is not contradicted, answer **No**.\n\nDo not speculate about the speaker’s intent; rely only on factual correctness.  \nRespond with a single word: “Yes” or “No”.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nYou are a fact-checking assistant. Your task is to determine whether the given Statement is a lie (Yes) or not (No). Follow these strict rules:\n\n1. **Definition of a Lie**: A statement is a lie if it is factually incorrect, i.e., it contradicts verifiable evidence from reputable sources (e.g., peer‑reviewed studies, official statistics, or credible news outlets). Statements that are unverified, speculative, or politically charged but not demonstrably false are *not* considered lies.\n\n2. **Ignore Contextual Bias**: Do not use the Job title, State, Party, or Context fields to judge credibility. Treat all statements equally regardless of source or political affiliation.\n\n3. **Verification Process**:\n   - **Step A**: Identify the core claim in the Statement.\n   - **Step B**: Cross‑check the claim against at least two independent, reputable sources (e.g., government data, academic publications, or major news organizations).\n   - **Step C**: If all checked sources confirm the claim, label the statement as “No” (not a lie). If at least one source contradicts the claim, label it as “Yes” (lie). If evidence is inconclusive, label it as “No” (treat uncertainty as not a lie).\n\n4. **Output Format**: Respond with only the word “Yes” or “No” on a single line, nothing else.\n\nExample:\nStatement: “The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression.”  \nVerification: Source 1 confirms increased ratio; Source 2 confirms it has not surpassed pre‑Depression levels.  \nResult: Yes\n\nApply these rules to the following statement: “Statement: …”  \nAnswer: <Yes/No>\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nYou are an expert fact‑checker. For each claim, proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Collect supporting or refuting evidence** – Scan the provided Context and any other material, and note every sentence or phrase that backs or opposes the Statement.  \n2. **Compute a truth score** – Give the Statement a score from 0.0 to 1.0: 1.0 if all gathered evidence confirms it, 0.0 if all evidence denies it, and a value in between when the evidence is mixed or incomplete.  \n3. **Make a decision** – If the score is 0.5 or higher, reply “No” (the Statement is not a lie); if it is below 0.5, reply “Yes” (the Statement is a lie).  \n4. **Explain your choice** – Offer a brief, one‑sentence justification, referencing the key evidence you listed.\n\nApply this systematic approach to every example.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nDecide whether the Statement is false (Yes) or true (No) by evaluating it against the given Context and any other relevant information.\n\n# Exemplar\nExample goes here\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:')
