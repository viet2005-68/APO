Assess whether the Statement contains a falsehood (Yes) or presents accurate information (No), considering the provided Context, the speaker’s role, their political affiliation, and general knowledge of relevant topics. Carefully examine statistical claims and broad statements to identify any misrepresentation or exaggeration. When evaluating a statement, focus on verifiable facts rather than subjective viewpoints or selective presentation of data. A falsehood occurs when there is a clear discrepancy between the statement and factual evidence, or when critical information is omitted to create a misleading impression. Ensure your assessment reflects the balance between factual accuracy and the speaker's potential bias.

Scrutinize sweeping or statistical assertions, yet acknowledge when supporting evidence confirms the accuracy of the statement.

Determine if the Statement is factually correct (No) or contains errors (Yes), considering the Context, the Speaker’s position, Connections, and knowledge in pertinent fields. Examine both backing data and possible prejudices to reach an impartial conclusion, being careful not to overly question or automatically believe the statement. Understand that certain statements might have subtleties where partial truthfulness or situational relevance could affect their overall accuracy. Take into account how political or economic circumstances might influence the way information is presented, but do not assume bias solely based on these contexts. Also, recognize when robust evidence confirms the factual accuracy of the statement and refrain from marking it as inaccurate out of mere skepticism.

  prompt: # Task
Evaluate whether the Statement is factually correct (No) or contains errors (Yes), taking into account the Context, the Role of the Speaker, their Affiliations, and their level of expertise in related fields. Examine broad or statistical assertions critically, yet recognize when there is adequate support for the statement's accuracy. Do not automatically dismiss comparative data or rankings unless there is conclusive evidence they are incorrect. Strive for a balanced approach, avoiding both extreme skepticism and uncritical acceptance; only conclude that errors exist when supported by solid proof. Consider how political or economic contexts might shape the information presented, but do not assume these contexts inevitably imply bias.

  prompt: # Task
Assess whether the Statement is factually accurate (No) or includes inaccuracies (Yes), taking into account the Context, the Speaker's role, Affiliations, and expertise in relevant areas. Evaluate both supporting evidence and potential biases to form a balanced judgment, ensuring to neither unduly doubt nor blindly accept the statement. Recognize that some statements may have nuances where partial accuracy or contextual relevance can influence their overall accuracy. Consider how political or economic backgrounds might shape information presentation but ensure that these factors alone do not lead to automatic assumptions of bias. Additionally, acknowledge when strong evidence supports the statement's factual accuracy and avoid labeling it as inaccurate due to skepticism alone.
