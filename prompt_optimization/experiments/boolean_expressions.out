Here\'s a variation of the instruction that maintains the same semantic meaning but uses slightly different wording and structure:\n\n---\n\nYou are provided with a logical expression that may contain the boolean operators `not`, `and`, and `or`, as well as parentheses. Note that the word **"is"** at the end of the input is **not part of the logical expression** — it is only used to indicate the conclusion of the statement.\n\nYou are required to **evaluate the expression strictly according to a defined order of operations**:\n\n1. **Parentheses** are evaluated first.\n2. **Operator precedence** is applied as follows:  \n   - `not` has the **highest precedence**  \n   - `and` has **higher precedence** than `or`\n3. After precedence is respected, the expression is evaluated **from left to right**.\n\nFor example:\n- `not True or (True or False)` is evaluated as:  \n    - `not True` → `False`  \n    - `True or False` → `True`  \n    - Then: `False or True` → `True` → Output: `"Yes"`\n\nIf the final result of the expression is **true**, output **"Yes"**.  \nIf the final result is **false**, output **"No"**.\n\nExamples:\n- Input: `"not True or (True or False) is"` → Output: `"Yes"`\n- Input: `"(False or not False) and False is"` → Output: `"No"`\n- Input: `"not not (not True) or False is"` → Output: `"No"`\n- Input: `"False and not (True) or True is"` → Output: `"Yes"`\n- Input: `"not not not not True and not True is"` → Output: `"No"`\n\nUse the above rules to evaluate each input accordingly.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you\'d like it further rephrased or adapted for a specific format!\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY "Yes" or "No".\nNO explanations.\nNo other words.\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\nHere\'s a variation of the instruction that retains the original semantic meaning, but rephrases the language for clarity and style:\n\n---\n\nYou are provided with a logical expression that may include the boolean operators `not`, `and`, and `or`, as well as parentheses.

Here is a variation of the instruction with the same semantic meaning but rephrased for clarity and style:

---

You are given a logical expression that includes the boolean operators `not`, `and`, and `or`, and may also contain parentheses. Note that the word "is" at the end of the input is **not** part of the logical expression—it is merely a delimiter marking the end of the statement.

Your task is to evaluate the logical expression that appears **before** the word "is" using **standard logic rules**:

1. The operator precedence is as follows: `not` has higher precedence than `and`, which has higher precedence than `or`.
2. Parentheses override the default precedence, just as in standard mathematical expressions.
3. You must evaluate the **entire expression** up to (but not including) "is" to determine its truth value.

If the result of the evaluation is **true**, output **"Yes"**.
If the result is **false**, output **"No"**.

Examples:
- Input: "not True or (True or False) is" → Output: "Yes"
- Input: "( False or not False and False ) is" → Output: "No"
- Input: "not not ( not True ) or False is" → Output: "No"
- Input: "False and not ( True ) or True is" → Output: "Yes"
- Input: "not not not not True and not True is" → Output: "No"

Use the specified rules to evaluate each input accordingly.
