Assess whether this headline uses exaggerated statements, sensational claims, or ambiguous references to concealed insights or startling revelations to capture interest instead of offering clear-cut data. Consider if it manipulates intrigue or suggests privileged insights to engage the audience, taking into account both the setting and the type of news. Decide if it leaves out crucial elements and appeals to intense feelings to persuade readers that the story contains more depth than the evidence actually supports. Also, judge if the headline gives enough background or verifiable details to back up its statements. Label it as clickbait if it depends largely on sensational wording without delivering specific information. Mark it as non-clickbait only if it combines dramatic flair with significant factual substance.

  prompt: # Task
Evaluate whether the given headline employs exaggerated expressions, dramatic claims, or ambiguous promises related to revealing secrets or startling truths primarily to capture attention rather than offering precise data. Identify if it utilizes language designed to arouse interest, suggest exclusive discoveries, or evoke strong emotions like urgency, concern, or excitement to engage readers without sharing explicit, factual content. Pay attention to whether the headline conveys a sense of distinctiveness or importance, making readers believe they will uncover insider information or miss crucial insights. Also, assess if important specifics are intentionally omitted to maintain curiosity, which could indicate clickbait. Verify that the headline explicitly mentions a particular incident or action with measurable consequences. If the headline does not contain such explicit references and depends on ambiguous or sensational phrasing without revealing specific information, it should be categorized as clickbait.

A headline that explicitly outlines a specific event or action with measurable consequences, even in the absence of sensational language, should not be labeled as clickbait. This assessment involves determining whether the headline gives enough detail for the reader to understand the primary topic without depending only on emotional triggers.

Is this headline crafted to attract attention by using overstated phrases, dramatic assertions, vague promises of revealing secrets, surprising truths, or by leveraging community events, local news, or relatable human-interest angles, rather than presenting straightforward facts? Consider whether the headline exploits curiosity, hints at exclusive knowledge, or taps into local pride and interest to draw readers in, even if it does not provide concrete, factual information. Evaluate if key details have been omitted or if strong emotions are being leveraged to entice readers into believing there is more substance to the story than what is actually supported by the facts. If these characteristics are present, categorize it as clickbait.

Label the headline as clickbait if these traits are evident; otherwise, consider it a direct and factual headline.

Assess if the provided headline relies on overstated phrases, sensational declarations, or unclear commitments about disclosing secrets or shocking facts, mainly aimed at grabbing attention rather than presenting clear facts. Determine if it uses wording meant to spark curiosity, hint at unique findings, or provoke intense feelings such as urgency, worry, or thrill, to attract readers without sharing concrete, factual information. Focus on whether the headline suggests a feeling of uniqueness or significance, leading readers to think they will discover insider details or miss vital insights. Also, consider if key details are deliberately left out to keep intrigue alive, potentially marking it as clickbait. Further, examine if the headline makes broad or vague promises of essential or extensive knowledge without specifying any particulars or referring directly to specific incidents or activities with quantifiable outcomes. Classify headlines that hinge on ambiguous terms, sensationalistic language, or wide-ranging promises without divulging specific information as clickbait. However, a headline that clearly describes a specific incident or activity with observable results, regardless of the use of sensational language, should not be labeled as clickbait. Your evaluation should focus on whether the headline offers sufficient information for the reader to grasp the main subject without depending merely on emotional appeals.
