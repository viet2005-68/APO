In your analysis, assess whether the Statement is logically aligned with the Context, suitable for the speaker\'s position or responsibilities, and supported by credible, widely recognized factual sources. If the Statement contradicts the Context or lacks substantiation from reliable sources, it should be categorized as a lie.\n\nBe particularly attentive to whether the Statement excludes critical information that significantly affects its interpretation or truthfulness. If such omissions are crucial to understanding the Statement’s meaning, it could be deemed misleading and thus classified as a lie. Additionally, evaluate whether the Statement is worded in a way that distorts the Context or selectively presents information to produce a deceptive impression, even if the Statement is generally factually accurate. In such cases, the Statement may still be considered a lie due to its specific contextual manipulation.\n\nTake into account the context in which the Statement is presented, including the medium (e.g., speech, flyer, TV ad), the intended audience, and the purpose of the communication. A Statement that is factually correct in a general sense but conveyed in a deceptive or misleading way within its specific context should be classified as a lie. Ensure that your evaluation considers both the literal truth of the Statement and its potential to mislead within the given Context.\n\nWhen assessing the Statement\'s accuracy, also take into consideration the speaker’s access to information and the communication standards expected of their role. If the Statement comes from someone in a position of authority or expertise, a higher standard of precision and completeness is expected. Conversely, if the Statement is issued by someone without relevant knowledge or authority, the evaluation should reflect the reasonable expectations for someone in that role. This criterion should be used to determine whether the Statement was made with a reasonable basis or if it relies on information the speaker was unlikely to have, which may suggest a falsehood, whether intentional or not.\n\nAdditionally, consider the norms of political communication and rhetorical expression. Statements that use exaggeration, selective emphasis, or framing common in political discourse may still be classified as lies if they are inconsistent with the Context, omit key information, or create a misleading impression in the specific communication setting. This includes examining whether the Statement is in line with the speaker’s known positions, communication style, and the broader conversation within their political or professional environment.\n\nPerform a comparative analysis by identifying whether the Statement presents an alternative version of events that directly conflicts with a well-established, widely reported account. If such a discrepancy exists, the Statement should be scrutinized closely for potential intent to mislead or misrepresent, even if the speaker is not explicitly stating a falsehood. This comparative approach ensures that the Statement is evaluated not only individually but also in relation to the broader factual and contextual framework.\n\nFurthermore, consider the plausibility of the information presented, including the source of any statistics or claims. If the Statement depends on a specific numerical claim or statistical assertion, assess whether that claim is supported by reputable data sources, whether the data is up-to-date and relevant, and whether the methodology used to derive the claim is transparent and verifiable. A Statement that cites a number without clear attribution or that utilizes outdated or unreliable data may be classified as a lie, even if the general idea is not inherently false.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY "Yes" or "No".\nNO explanations.\nNo other words.\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:\n\n# Output format\nAnswer ONLY "Yes" or "No".\nNO explanations.\nNo other words.\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:', '# Task\n# Task\n**Revised Instruction (Alternative Version):**\n\nEvaluate whether the Statement constitutes a lie (Yes) or is not a lie (No) by thoroughly examining its factual accuracy, potential for misleading interpretation, and consistency with reliable evidence, the Context, the speaker’s role, and established knowledge. A lie encompasses any statement that is factually inaccurate, misleading, or inconsistent with known facts, regardless of the speaker’s intent. This includes statements that leave out important information that would significantly change how the statement is understood or assessed.\n\nTo assess the Statement, start by checking if it corresponds with objective, publicly available records, official documents, or credible sources. Then, determine if the Statement logically follows from the Context and is in line with the speaker’s position or responsibilities. Be particularly careful to identify whether the Statement creates a false impression or distorts the truth through selective omission, overstatement, or strategic framing.\n\nA crucial new element to consider is the "contextual completeness" of the Statement: any claim that relies on an unmentioned condition or assumes a particular background should be examined to see if that condition or background is adequately presented or omitted in a way that causes confusion or misrepresentation. The Statement should be judged not just on its surface meaning, but also in relation to all relevant surrounding information that a reasonable person would expect to be included for clarity and honesty.\n\nTake into account the *credibility of the claim* based on the speaker’s known behavior, previous actions, or documented history. If the Statement conflicts with verified facts, lacks solid support, or depends heavily on omissions that distort its meaning, it should be regarded as a lie. If the Statement is vague or lacks sufficient context, use the most reasonable judgment based on factual evidence and logical reasoning to reach a conclusion.\n\nGive priority to identifying statements that are misleading or inconsistent with the context, even if they are not outright factually false. When assessing claims about specific actions or financial disclosures, demand clear documentation or record-keeping as a standard for verification. Any assertion that cannot be independently confirmed through official records or trustworthy sources should be treated with caution, unless it is clearly supported by the Context or the speaker’s documented background.\n\nPay particular attention to statements that seem factual but are selectively presented to mislead or obscure a larger situation. A statement that is technically accurate but lacks essential context to create a deceptive impression should still be considered a lie.

If the Statement cannot be confirmed through these sources, it should be classified as a lie unless it is explicitly supported by the Context or the speaker’s documented background.\n\nNext, assess whether the Statement logically follows from the Context and aligns with the speaker’s role or responsibilities. However, if the Statement is factually contradictory, lacks credible evidence, or relies on significant omissions that distort its meaning, it must be deemed a lie, regardless of the speaker’s position or the apparent support from the Context.\n\nWhen evaluating claims about specific actions, financial disclosures, or legislative decisions, require clear, documented evidence as the standard for verification. Any assertion that cannot be confirmed through official records or trusted sources should be classified as a lie unless the Context offers explicit, verifiable support for the claim.\n\nBefore reaching a conclusion, carefully consider whether the Statement might be subject to multiple interpretations. If the Statement is ambiguous or open to different readings, classify it as a lie unless the Context or supporting documentation clearly resolves the ambiguity in favor of the Statement’s accuracy.\n\nAmbiguity, lack of context, or insufficient evidence cannot serve as a basis for classifying a Statement as not a lie. Instead, apply the most reasonable judgment based on factual evidence and logical reasoning. Always prioritize factual accuracy over contextual or role-based considerations, even when there is a conflict between the two.\n\nEnsure that the evaluation is rooted in objective evidence and not based on assumptions, subjective interpretations, or the speaker\'s credibility. The speaker’s authority, position, or intent should not affect the truth value of the Statement.

A lie includes any statement that is factually incorrect, misleading, or inconsistent with established facts, regardless of the speaker’s intent. This also applies to statements that deliberately omit key information that would significantly alter the understanding or evaluation of the claim.\n\nTo evaluate the Statement, start by verifying whether it aligns with objective, publicly accessible records, official documents, or credible sources. Next, assess whether the Statement logically follows from the Context and is consistent with the speaker’s role, responsibilities, or prior statements. Pay close attention to whether the Statement misleads by selectively omitting, exaggerating, or framing information in a way that distorts the truth.\n\nAn important consideration is the "contextual completeness" of the Statement. Any claim that depends on an unmentioned condition or assumes a specific background should be examined to determine whether that condition or background is clearly presented or omitted in a way that leads to confusion or misrepresentation. The evaluation should consider not just the statement’s face value, but also the surrounding information that a reasonable person would expect to be included for clarity and honesty.\n\nAlso take into account the *credibility of the claim* based on the speaker’s known behavior, past actions, or documented history.

A statement that is technically accurate but lacks essential context to create a deceptive impression should still be considered a lie. Ensure that your evaluation is rooted in objective evidence, not in assumptions or subjective interpretation.\n\nIntroduce a new criterion: the "proportionality of omission." If the Statement omits information that is significantly relevant to the claim made, it may be considered misleading or incomplete, even if the core claim is otherwise accurate. For example, if a statement is made about a policy’s effects, but critical limitations, exceptions, or counterarguments are omitted in a way that disproportionately affects the interpretation, this omission should be viewed as potentially deceptive.\n\nAdditionally, consider the speaker’s role and the nature of the Context when evaluating the Statement. Individuals in positions of authority, such as political figures or public officials, are expected to maintain higher standards of factual accuracy, particularly when communicating in formal settings, campaign materials, or public speeches. Such statements should be scrutinized more strictly, as they may influence public opinion or policy decisions.

**Revised Instruction:**

Determine whether the Statement qualifies as a lie (Yes) or is not a lie (No) by conducting a comprehensive analysis of its factual accuracy, potential for misrepresentation, and alignment with reliable evidence, the Context provided, the speaker's role, and general knowledge. A lie is defined as any statement that is factually incorrect, misleading, or inconsistent with established facts, regardless of the speaker's intent. This includes statements that deliberately omit key information that would significantly alter the meaning or truth value of the claim.

To evaluate the Statement, first assess whether it is supported by objective, publicly available records, official documents, or credible sources. Next, verify whether the Statement logically follows from the Context and is consistent with the speaker’s responsibilities or role. Be especially attentive to claims that may be misleading due to selective omissions, exaggerations, or biased framing.

A critical aspect of the evaluation is the *contextual completeness* of the Statement: any claim that relies on a specific, unstated condition or assumes a particular background must be examined to determine whether that condition or background is accurately represented or omitted in a way that could lead to misunderstanding. The Statement must be judged not only on its own terms but also in relation to all relevant surrounding information that a reasonable person would expect to see for clarity and truthfulness.

Take into account the *plausibility of the claim* in light of the speaker’s known behavior, past actions, or public records. If the Statement contradicts verified facts, lacks credible support, or depends on significant omissions that distort its meaning, it should be classified as a lie. If the Statement is ambiguous or lacks necessary context, use the most reasonable judgment based on factual evidence and logical reasoning to reach a conclusion.

Focus on identifying statements that are misleading or inconsistent with the Context, even if they are not outright factually false. When evaluating statements about specific actions or financial disclosures, require clear documentation or record-keeping as a standard for confirmation. Any claim that cannot be independently verified through official records or trusted sources should be treated with caution, unless it is clearly supported by the Context or the speaker’s documented history.

Be particularly attentive to statements that appear factual but are selectively presented to create a misleading impression of a larger situation. A statement that is technically accurate but omits essential context to distort the overall picture is still considered a lie. Ensure that the evaluation is based on objective evidence rather than assumptions or subjective interpretations.

In addition, explicitly outline the reasoning process: describe which part of the Statement is misleading or factually inconsistent, which part of the Context supports or contradicts the Statement, and how the speaker’s role or responsibilities influence the interpretation of the Statement. This reasoning must be grounded in objective evidence, logical reasoning, and the Context provided.

**New Structural Requirement:** When assessing a claim, determine whether the Statement is *independent of its source*—that is, whether the Statement could be independently verified without relying solely on the speaker’s credibility or the Context provided. If the Statement cannot be validated without referencing the speaker’s role or the Context, it must be closely examined for potential bias, omission, or framing that could distort its meaning. This step ensures that the evaluation is based on external, verifiable facts rather than internal assumptions or contextual dependencies.
